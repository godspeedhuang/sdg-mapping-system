0,Indicator1-1-1,"Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line by sex, age, employment status and geographic location (urban/rural)","Definition:The indicator “proportion of the population below the international poverty line” is defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $2.15 a day at 2017 international prices. Concepts:In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty, one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for that country. But how do we talk meaningfully about “global poverty?” Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. But to consistently measure global absolute poverty in terms of consumption we need to treat two people with the same purchasing power over commodities the same way—both are either poor or not poor—even if they live in different countries.Since World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world's poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using purchaing power parity (PPP) exchange rates, was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in September 2022, when the World Bank adopted $2.15 as the international poverty line using the 2017 PPP. Prior to that, the 2015 update set the international poverty line at $1.90 using the 2011 PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries and over time. "
1,Indicator1-2-1,"Proportion of population living below the national poverty line, by sex and age","Definition:The national poverty rate is the percentage of the total population living below the national poverty line. The rural poverty rate is the percentage of the rural population living below the national poverty line (or in cases where a separate, rural poverty line is used, the rural poverty line). Urban poverty rate is the percentage of the urban population living below the national poverty line (or in cases where a separate, urban poverty line is used, the urban poverty line). Concepts:In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty according to national definitions, one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for that country. Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. Within a country, the cost of living is typically higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Some countries may have separate urban and rural poverty lines to represent different purchasing powers. "
2,Indicator1-2-2,"Proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions","Definition:The following five series are used to monitor the SDG 1.2.2. 1)	Official multidimensional poverty headcount, by sex, and age (% of population)The percentage of people who are multidimensionally poor2)	Average share of weighted deprivations (intensity) for total populationThe average share of weighted dimensions in which poor people are deprived among total population  3)	Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of total households)The percentage of households who are multidimensionally poor4)            Average share of weighted deprivations (intensity) for total householdsThe average share of weighted dimensions in which poor people are deprived among total households  5)	Multidimensional deprivation for children (% of population under 18)The percentage of children who are simultaneously deprived in multiple material dimensions Concepts:The design of a measure of multidimensional poverty is different in each country, but regardless of the exact methodology selected, it still follows a similar process to define the features of the measure, which include: i) the purpose of the measure; ii) the unit of identification (most frequently either the household or the individuals); iii) the dimensions and respective indicators that delimit which deprivations should be measured; iv) the methodology for developing the measure (including deprivation cut-offs, weights, and poverty cut-offs).The most commonly used method is the Alkire Foster (AF) methodology which identifies dimensions, typically health, education and living standards and several indicators in each dimension. The unit of analysis could be either the individual or the household. The individuals or households are considered as multidimensionally poor if they are deprived in multiple dimensions, exceeding certain thresholds. EU Member States, Island, Norway, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey have a different approach to measure the multidimensional poverty using the concept of ""people at risk of poverty or social exclusion"" (AROPE) calculated by EUROSTAT using the data from EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). AROPE consists of three components, and individuals are considered as ""at risk of poverty or social exclusion"" if they are ""at risk of poverty"" or ""severely materially and socially deprived"" or ""living in a household with a very low work intensity"". There is a multidimensional poverty measure specifically designed for children. A child is considered multidimensionally poor if s/he is simultaneously deprived in multiple dimensions. It identifies the dimensions of poverty and the indicators under each dimension, and has a similar structure to the AF methodology. However, it is different in that it focuses on the life-cycle of children, creating different sets of dimensions and indicators for different age groups (e.g., for ages 0-4, 5-11, 12-14, 15-17 years), and conducts analyses separately for each age group. In the global SDG database, the multidimensional poverty headcount (%) for the overall 0-17 age group has been used for countries reporting individual measures of child multidimensional poverty."
3,Indicator1-3-1,"Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable","Definition:The indicator reflects the proportion of persons effectively covered by a social protection system, including social protection floors. It also reflects the main components of social protection: child and maternity benefits, support for persons without a job, persons with disabilities, victims of work injuries and older persons. Effective coverage of social protection is measured by the number of people who are either actively contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving benefits (contributory or non-contributory).
Concepts: Social protection systems include contributory and non-contributory schemes for children, pregnant women with newborns, people in active age, older persons, for victims of work injuries and persons with disabilities. Social protection floors provide at least a basic level in all main contingencies along the life cycle, as defined in the Social Protection Floors Recommendation 2012 (no. 202) referred to in SDG 1.3. When assessing coverage and gaps in coverage, distinctions need to be made between coverage by (1) contributory social insurance, (2) universal schemes covering all residents (or all residents in a given category), and (3) means-tested schemes potentially covering all those who pass the required test of income and/or assets."
4,Indicator1-4-1,Proportion of population living in households with access to basic services,"Definition:The proportion of population living in households with access to basic services is defined as the proportion of population using public service provision systems that meet basic human needs including drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, energy, mobility, waste collection, health care, education and information technologies. The basic services indicator is therefore based on 9 components. These components are captured in various standalone indicators of the SDGs, which means that the concepts and definitions of SDG indicator 1.4.1 will be derived from or are the same as those of these specific SDG indicators. Concepts:The term ‘access to basic services’ implies that sufficient and affordable service is reliably available with adequate quality.Access to Basic Drinking Water Services refers to the use of drinking water from an improved source with a collection time of not more than 30 minutes for a round trip, including queuing. ‘Improved’ drinking water sources include the following:: piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, water kiosks, and packaged or delivered water. This definition is based on the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) drinking water ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.1.1 - Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services. Access to Basic Sanitation Services refers to the use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households. An ‘improved sanitation facility’ is defined as one designed to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact. Improved sanitation facilities include wet sanitation technologies such as flush or pour flush toilets connected to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines; and dry sanitation technologies such as dry pit latrines with slabs (constructed from materials that are durable and easy to clean), ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines, pit latrines with a slab, composting toilets and container-based sanitation. If a household uses a flush or pour flush toilet but does not know where it is flushed to, the sanitation facility is considered to be improved since the household may not be aware about whether it flushes to a sewer, septic tank or pit latrine. This definition is based on the JMP sanitation ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.2.1a - Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services . Access to Basic Hygiene Facilities refers to availability of a handwashing facility with soap and water at home. Handwashing facilities may be located within the dwelling, yard or plot. Handwashing facilities may be fixed or mobile and include a sink with tap water, buckets with taps, tippy-taps, and jugs or basins designated for handwashing. Soap includes bar soap, liquid soap, powder detergent, and soapy water but does not include ash, soil, sand or other handwashing agents.  This definition is based on the JMP hygiene ladder and is the foundation for SDG indicator 6.2.1b - Proportion of population  with handwashing facilities with soap and water available at home. For many low and middle-income countries, achieving universal access to basic drinking water, sanitation and hygiene remains a high priority, which will help them achieve access to ‘safely managed services’, the target for SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2. Access to clean fuels and technology refers to use of fuels and technology that are defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e., against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion. This component will be captured through SDG 7.1.2 - Percentage of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology.Access to Basic Mobility refers to having convenient access to transport in a rural context (SDG 9.1.1) or having convenient access to public transport in an urban context (SDG 11.2.1).  Access to mobility rural contextTo eradicate poverty, communities need to be connected to socio-economic opportunities by roads that are passable all season and attract reliable and affordable public transport services. In many areas, safe footpaths, footbridges and waterways may be required in conjunction with, or as an alternative, to roads. For reasons of simplification, specific emphasis was given to roads in this definition (based on the Rural Access Index - RAI - percentage of the population <2km from an all-season road (equivalent to a walk of 20-25 mins)) since road transport reflects accessibility for the great majority of people in rural contexts. In those situations where another mode, such as water transport is dominant the definition will be modified and contextualized to reflect and capture those aspects. Access to mobility has shown some of the largest impacts on poverty reduction and has a strong correlation to educational, economic and health outcomes (“transport as an enabler”).   RAI is the most widely accepted metric for tracking access to transport in rural areas and has been included in the SDGs as SDG indicator 9.1.1 - Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road. This component will be therefore captured through SDG 9.1.1.The existing RAI methodology relies on household level survey data – however, is currently being revised into a GIS-based index that exploits advances in digital technology with the aim to create a more accurate and cost-effective tool. Access to mobility urban contextThe urban context of access to transport is measured utilizing the methodology of SDG 11.2.1 –Proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport by sex, age and persons with disabilities. The metadata methodology is available (UN-Habitat being the custodian agency). City delimitation is conducted to identify the urban area which will act as the spatial analysis scope as inventory of available public stops in the service areas is collected. Identification of population served by available street network allows for measurement 500m and/or 1km walkable distance to nearest stop (“service area”). We know that measuring spatial access is not sufficient and does not address the temporal dimension associated with the availability of public transport. Complementary to the above, other parameters of tracking the transport target related to street density/no. of intersections, affordability, or quality in terms of safety, travel time, universal access, are all tracked. Access to Basic Waste Collection Services refers to the access that the population have to a reliable waste collection service, including both formal municipal and informal sector services. This is connected to and will be captured through SDG Indicator 11.6.1 - Proportion of municipal solid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out of total municipal waste generated, by cities. A ‘collection service’ may be ‘door to door’ or by deposit into a community container. ‘Collection’ includes collection for recycling as well as for treatment and disposal (includes e.g., collection of recyclables by itinerant waste buyers). ‘Reliable’ means regular - frequency will depend on local conditions and on any pre-separation of the waste. For example, both mixed waste and organic waste are often collected daily in tropical climates for public health reasons, and generally at least weekly; source-separated dry recyclables may be collected less frequently.Access to Basic Health Care Services refers to access to services that cover in and out-of-area emergency services, in-patient hospital and physician care, outpatient medical services, laboratory and radiology services, and preventive health services. Basic health care services also extend to access to limited treatment of mental illness and substance abuse in accordance with minimum standards prescribed by local and national ministries of health. This is connected to and will be measured through SDG indicator 3.8.1 – Coverage of essential health services.Access to Basic Education refers to access to education services that provides all learners with capabilities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being. This is connected to and will be captured through SDG 4.1.1 - Proportion of children and young people (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex.  Access to Basic Information Services refers to having a broadband internet access. Broadband is defined as technologies that deliver advertised download speeds of at least 256 kbit/s. Connecting the 50% of the world that is still offline means, in large part, ensuring that everyone, everywhere is able to access an internet that is affordable. The main types of broadband services are: 1) Fixed (wired) broadband network, such as DSL, cable modem, high speed leased lines, fibre to-the-home/building, powerline and other fixed (wired) broadband; 2) Terrestrial fixed (wireless) broadband network, such as WiMAX, fixed CDMA; 3) Satellite broadband network (via a satellite connection); 4) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a handset and 5) Mobile broadband network (at least 3G, e.g. UMTS) via a card (e.g. integrated SIM card in a computer) or USB modem. This is connected to and will be captured through SDG 9.c.1 - Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology."
5,Indicator1-4-2,"Proportion of total adult population with secure tenure rights to land, (a) with legally recognized documentation, and (b) who perceive their rights to land as secure, by sex and type of tenure","Definition:Indicator 1.4.2 measures the relevant part of Target 1.4 (ensure men and women have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to …, ownership of and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources). It measures the results of policies that aim to strengthen tenure security for all, including women and other vulnerable groups.Indicator 1.4.2 covers (a) all types of land use (such as residential, commercial, agricultural, forestry, grazing, wetlands based on standard land-use classification) in both rural and urban areas; and (b) all land tenure types as recognized at the country level, such as freehold, leasehold, public land, customary land. An individual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household, or collectively as member of group, cooperative or other type of association. Secure tenure rights: comprised of two sub-components: (i) legally recognized documentation and (ii) perception of the security of tenure, which are both necessary to provide a full measurement of tenure security. Legally recognized documentation: Legal documentation of rights refers to the recording and publication of information on the nature and location of land, rights and right holders in a form that is recognized by government, and is therefore official.  For purposes of computing SDG Indicator 1.4.2, the country specific metadata will define what documentation on land rights will be counted as legally recognized (see next section for rationale).Perceived security of tenure: Perception of tenure security refers to an individual’s perception of the likelihood of involuntary loss of land, such as disagreement of the ownership rights over land or ability to use it, regardless of the formal status and can be more optimistic or pessimistic. Although those without land rights’ documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with documentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are insufficient to guarantee tenure security. Conversely, even without legally recognized documentation, individuals may feel themselves to be protected against eviction or dispossession. Therefore, capturing and analysing these diverse ranges of situations will enable a more comprehensive understanding of land tenure security, based on a country specific context.For purposes of constructing the indicator (see next section for rationale), we define perceptions of tenure to be secure if:The landholder does not report a fear of involuntary loss of the land within the next five years due to, for example, intra-family, community or external threats and The landholder reports having the right to bequeath the land. Total adult population:  A country’s adult population is measured by census data or through surveys using an adequate sampling frame.Interpretation:One motivation that makes the indicator actionable is that, in many developing countries, the gap between data on the availability of documentation and on perception of tenure security can be large. For example, tenure may be perceived as secure, even though rights are not formally documented, as in the case of customary systems and trusted local land governance arrangements. Or, the opposite, tenure may be perceived as insecure even when there is a high level of formal documentation of rights. The latter situation can be caused by various factors, including limited trust in land administration services, possible duplicated documents, high cost of having state institutions protecting such rights.Reporting on perceived security will provide important information on people’s satisfaction with the institutional quality of service, transparency, appropriateness, accessibility and affordability of land administration services and justice systems.Concepts:The concepts below are based on the “Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Forests and Fisheries in the Context of National Food Security” (shorthand VGGT), which were endorsed by the United Nations World Committee on World Food Security in 2012 and therefore considered an internationally accepted standard. Other international frameworks using these concepts are the African Union Agenda on Land as laid out in the 2009 Framework and Guidelines on Land Policy in Africa and the 2014 Nairobi Action Plan on Large-Scale Land-Based Investments.Tenure: How people, communities and others gain access to land and natural resources (including fisheries and forests) is defined and regulated by societies through systems of tenure. These tenure systems determine who can use which resources, for how long, and under what conditions. Tenure systems may be based on written policies and laws, as well as on unwritten customs and practices. No tenure right, including private ownership, is absolute. All tenure rights are limited by the rights of others and by the measures taken by states for public purposes (VGGT, 2012).Tenure typology: A tenure typology is country specific and refers to categories of tenure rights, for example customary, leasehold, public and freehold. Rights can be held collectively, jointly or individually and may cover one or more elements of the bundle of rights (the right of possession, of control, of exclusion, of enjoyment and of disposition).Land governance: Rules, processes and structures through which decisions are made regarding access to and the use (and transfer) of land, how those decisions are implemented and the way that conflicting interests in land are managed. States provide legal recognition for tenure rights through policies, law and land administration services, and define the categories of rights that are considered official."
6,Indicator1-5-1,"Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population","Definition:This indicator measures the number of people who died, went missing or were directly affected by disasters per 100,000 population. Concepts:Death: The number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event.Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead, for whom there is no physical evidence such as a body, and for which an official/legal report has been filed with competent authorities.Directly affected:  The number of people who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected are people who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time, due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructure, basic services, commerce or work, or social, health and psychological consequences."
7,Indicator1-5-2,Direct economic loss attributed to disasters in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP),"Definition:This indicator measures the ratio of direct economic loss attributed to disasters in relation to GDP.Concepts:Economic Loss: Total economic impact that consists of direct economic loss and indirect economic loss.Direct economic loss: the monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Direct economic loss is nearly equivalent to physical damage.Indirect economic loss: a decline in economic value added as a consequence of direct economic loss and/or human and environmental impacts.Annotations: Examples of physical assets that are the basis for calculating direct economic loss include homes, schools, hospitals, commercial and governmental buildings, transport, energy, telecommunications infrastructures and other infrastructure; business assets and industrial plants; production such as crops, livestock and production infrastructure. They may also encompass environmental assets and cultural heritage.  Direct economic losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure."
8,Indicator1-5-3,Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030,Definition:[a] An open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework. These indicators will eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators.
9,Indicator1-5-4,Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies,"Definition:The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is: “Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”.In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience.The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG report A/71/644). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai Framework indicators."
10,Indicator1-a-1,Total official development assistance grants from all donors that focus on poverty reduction as a share of the recipient country’s gross national income,"Definition:Total official development assistance (ODA) grants from all donors that focus on poverty reduction as a share of the recipient country’s gross national income. The OECD/Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as “flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i)  provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii)  each transaction  is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent).

12,Indicator1-b-1,Pro-poor public social spending,"Definition:Proportion of government spending towards which benefit directly the monetary poor in health, education and direct transfers. Government spending measures public expenditures on health and education services. Direct transfers refer to cash transfers and near-cash transfers. The definition of the monetary poor follows national standards, with poverty levels determined by national definition of income or consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1). Concepts:Proportion of public spending: Expenditures by governments on health, education and direct transfers (cash transfers and near-cash transfers).  The poor: Monetary Poverty as determined by national definition of income/consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1).  "
13,Indicator2-1-1,Prevalence of undernourishment,"Definition: The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) (French: pourcentage de sous-alimentation; Spanish: porcentaje de sub-alimentación; Italian: prevalenza di sotto-alimentazione) is an estimate of the proportion of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. It is expressed as a percentage.Concepts: Undernourishment is defined as the condition by which a person has access, on a regular basis, to the amount of food that are insufficient to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements. Though strictly related, “undernourishment” as defined here is different from the physical conditions of “malnutrition” and “undernutrition” as it refers to the condition of insufficient intake of food, rather than to the outcome in terms of nutritional status. In French, Spanish and Italian the difference is marked by the use of the terms alimentation, alimentación, or alimentazione, instead of nutrition, nutrición or nutrizione, in the name of the indicator. A more appropriate expression in English that would render the precise meaning of the indicator might have been “prevalence of under-feeding” but by now the term “undernourishment” has long been associated with the indicator. While the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, due to conceptual and data-related considerations, the indicator can only be referred to a population, or group of individuals. The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in a group that are in that condition, but it does not allow for the identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, undernourished. "
14,Indicator2-1-2,"Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population, based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)","Definition:The indicator measures the percentage of individuals in the population who have experienced food insecurity at moderate or severe levels during the reference period. The severity of food insecurity, defined as a latent trait, is measured on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale global reference scale, a measurement standard established by FAO through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale in more than 140 countries worldwide, starting in 2014.Concepts:Extensive research over more than 25 years has demonstrated that the inability to access food results in a series of experiences and conditions that are fairly common across cultures and socio-economic contexts and that range from being concerned about the ability to obtain enough food, to the need to compromise on the quality or the diversity of food consumed, to being forced to reduce the intake of food by cutting portion sizes or skipping meals, up to the extreme condition of feeling hungry and not having means to access any food for a whole day. Typical conditions like these form the basis of an experience-based food insecurity measurement scale. When analysed through sound statistical methods rooted in Item Response Theory, data collected through such scales provide the basis to compute theoretically consistent, cross country comparable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity. The severity of the food insecurity condition as measured by this indicator thus directly reflects the extent of households’ or individuals’ inability to regularly access the food they need."

Overweight can however also be assessed with other indicators such body mass index (BMI)-for-age. In general BMI-for-age is not used in the joint database of primary sources (e.g., household surveys) but has been considered in absence of any other available estimates.  "
17,Indicator2-2-3,"Prevalence of anaemia in women aged 15 to 49 years, by pregnancy status (percentage)","Definition:Percentage of women aged 15−49 years with a haemoglobin concentration less than 120 g/L for non-pregnant women and lactating women, and less than 110 g/L for pregnant women, adjusted for altitude and smoking.Concepts:Anaemia: condition in which the concentration of blood haemoglobin concentration falls below established cut-off values.Iron deficiency: state in which there is insufficient iron to maintain the normal physiological function of blood, brain and muscles (ICD-11, 5B5K.0 iron deficiency)Iron deficiency anaemia: (ICD-11, 3A00, iron deficiency anaemia)Blood haemoglobin concentration: concentration of haemoglobin in whole blood"
18,Indicator2-3-1,Volume of production per labour unit by classes of farming/pastoral/forestry enterprise size,"Definition:Volume of agricultural production of small-scale food producer in crop, livestock, fisheries, and forestry activities per number of days worked. The indicator is computed as a ratio of annual output to the number of working days in one year. As the indicator is referred to a set of production units – those of a small scale — the denominator needs to summarize information on the entire production undertaken in each unit. This requires that volumes of production are reported in a common numeraire, given that it is impossible to sum up physical units. The most convenient numeraire for aggregating products in the numerator is a vector of constant prices. When measured at different points in time, as required by the monitoring of the SDG indicators, changes in constant values represent aggregated volume changes. FAO proposes to define small-scale food producers as producers who: operate an amount of land falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of land size at national level (measured in hectares); and operate a number of livestock falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of the number of livestock per production unit at national level (measured in Tropical Livestock Units – TLUs); and obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural activities falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production unit at national level (measured in Purchasing Power Parity Dollars) not exceeding 34,387 Purchasing Power Parity Dollars.Concepts:The following concepts are adopted for the computation of indicators 2.3.1:Small-scale food producers are defined as those falling in the intersection of the bottom 40 percent of the cumulative distribution of land, livestock and revenues.Tropical Livestock Units are a conversion scale used for standardization and measurement of the number of livestock heads. One TLU is the metabolic weight equivalent of one cattle in North America. The complete list of conversion factors can be found in the Guidelines for the preparation of livestock sector Reviews  The concept of productivity is standardized by OECD’s Manual for Measuring Productivity. This defines productivity as “a ratio of a volume measure of outputs to a volume measure of input use.” More information on possible definitions can be found in “Productivity and Efficiency Measurement in Agriculture: Literature Review and Gaps Analysis”."
19,Indicator2-3-2,"Average income of small-scale food producers, by sex and indigenous status","Definition:SDG indicator 2.3.2 measures income from on-farm production activities, which is related to the production of food and agricultural products. This includes income from crop production, livestock production, fisheries and aquaculture production, and from forestry production. The indicator is computed as annual income. FAO proposes to define small-scale food producers as producers who: operate an amount of land falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of land size at national level (measured in hectares); and operate a number of livestock falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of the number of livestock per production unit at national level (measured in Tropical Livestock Units – TLUs); and obtain an annual economic revenue from agricultural activities falling in the first two quintiles (the bottom 40 percent) of the cumulative distribution of economic revenues from agricultural activities per production unit at national level (measured in Purchasing Power Parity Dollars) not exceeding 34,387 Purchasing Power Parity Dollars.Concepts:The following concepts are adopted for the computation of indicators 2.3.2:Small-scale food producers are defined as those falling in the intersection of the bottom 40 percent of the cumulative distribution of land, livestock and revenues.Tropical Livestock Units are a conversion scale used for standardization and measurement of the number of livestock heads. One TLU is the metabolic weight equivalent of one cattle in North America. The complete list of conversion factors can be found in the Guidelines for the preparation of livestock sector Reviews  The computation of income is based on the resolution adopted by the 17th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). Income should be computed by deducting from revenues the operating costs and the depreciation of assets."
20,Indicator2-4-1,Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture,"Definition:The scope of indicator 2.4.1 is the agricultural farm holding, and more precisely the agricultural land area of the farm holding, i.e. land used primarily to grow crops and raise livestock. This choice of scope is fully consistent with the intended use of a country’s agricultural land area as the denominator of the aggregate indicator. Specifically, the following are:Included within scope:Intensive and extensive crops and livestock production systems.Subsistence agriculture.State and common land when used exclusively and managed by the farm holding.Food and non-food crops and livestock products (e.g. tobacco, cotton, and sheep wool). Crops grown for fodder or for energy purposes.Agro-forestry (trees on the agriculture areas of the farm).Aquaculture, to the extent that it takes place within the agricultural land area. For example, rice-fish farming and similar systems. Excluded from scope:State and common land not used exclusively by the farm holding.Nomadic pastoralism.Production from gardens and backyards. Production from hobby farms.Holdings focusing exclusively on aquaculture. Holdings focusing exclusively on forestry.Food harvested from the wild.Concepts:The literature review (Hayati, 2017) identified a large number of potential sustainability themes across the three dimensions of sustainability and, for each theme, usually a large number of possible sub-indicators. The key considerations in the selection of themes are relevance and measurability. In terms of relevance, the relationship between the associated sub-indicator and sustainable agriculture outcomes at farm level should be strong. Following this approach, only sub-indicators that are responsive to farm level policies aimed at improving sustainable agriculture are considered. In terms of measurability, only a “core” set of themes and sub-indicators for which measurement and reporting is expected in the majority of countries are selected.A key aspect of all approaches to measuring sustainable agriculture is the recognition that sustainability is a multi-dimensional concept, and that these multiple dimensions need to be reflected in the construction of the indicator. This implies that SDG indicator 2.4.1 must be based on a set of sub-indicators that cover these three dimensions.Through a consultative process that has lasted over two years, 11 themes and sub-indicators have been identified, which make up SDG 2.4.1.Please see the annex for a detailed description of the sub-indicators."
21,Indicator2-5-1,Number of (a) plant and (b) animal genetic resources for food and agriculture secured in either medium- or long-term conservation facilities,"Definition:The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium- or long-term conservation facilities (ex situ, in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm.The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm.The two components of the indicator 2.5.1, plant (a) and animal (b) GRFA, are separately counted.The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium- or long-term conditions, where an ‘accession’ is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (accessible at http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/), set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Fourteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf). Concepts:Plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA): Any genetic material of plant origin of actual or potential value for food and agriculture.Accession: An accession is defined as a sample of seeds, planting materials or plants representing either a wild population, a landrace, a breeding line or an improved cultivar, which is conserved in a genebank. Each accession should be distinct and, in terms of genetic integrity, as close as possible to the sample provided originally.Base collection: A base collection is defined as a set of unique accessions to be preserved for a medium to long-term period.Active collection: An active collection is defined as a set of distinct accessions that is used for regeneration, multiplication, distribution, characterization and evaluation. Active collections are maintained in short to medium-term storage and usually duplicated in a base collection. Medium- or long-term conservation facilities: Biological diversity is often conserved ex situ, outside its natural habitat, in facilities called genebanks. In the case of plant genetic resources, genebanks conserve base collections under medium- or long-term storage conditions, in the form of seeds in cold rooms, plants in the field and tissues in vitro and/or cryoconserved. "
22,Indicator2-5-2,Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk of extinction,"Definition: The indicator presents the percentage of local livestock breeds among local breeds with known risk status classified as being at risk of extinctions at a certain moment in time, as well as the trends for this percentage.Concepts: A similar indicator was originally proposed for the Target 15.5, and it serves also as an indicator for the Aichi Target 13 “Genetic Diversity of Terrestrial Domesticated Animals” under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It is described on the webpage of the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership (BIP), a network of organizations, which have come together to provide the most up-to date biodiversity information possible for tracking progress towards the Aichi Targets (http://www.bipindicators.net/domesticatedanimals). Further, it is presented in the Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, page 91 (see https://www.cbd.int/gbo/gbo4/publication/gbo4-en.pdf ) which is an output of the processes under the CBD."
23,Indicator2-a-1,The agriculture orientation index for government expenditures,"Definition:The Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) for Government Expenditures is defined as the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, divided by the Agriculture value added share of GDP, where Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector. The measure is a currency-free index, calculated as the ratio of these two shares. National governments are requested to compile Government Expenditures according to the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) and the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG), and Agriculture value added share of GDP according to the System of National Accounts (SNA).Concepts:Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector, or Division A of ISIC Rev 4 (equal to Division A+B of ISIC Rev 3.2). Government Expenditure comprise all expense and acquisition of non-financial assets associated with supporting a particular sector, as defined in the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 developed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). NOTE: Transactions in assets and liabilities, such as loans by general government units (disbursement and repayment), are excluded when compiling COFOG data for GFS reporting purposes.Government Expenditure are classified according to the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG), a classification developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published by the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD). Agriculture value-added and GDP are based on the System of National Accounts (SNA). "
24,Indicator2-a-2,Total official flows (official development assistance plus other official flows) to the agriculture sector,"Definition:Gross disbursements of total ODA and other official flows from all donors to the agriculture sector.Concepts:ODA: The DAC defines ODA as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and each transaction   is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; andis concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional.(See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf,  Para 24).The agriculture sector is as defined by the DAC and comprises all CRS sector codes in the 311 series (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm)"
25,Indicator2-b-1,Agricultural export subsidies,"Definition:Agricultural export subsidies are defined as export subsidies budgetary outlays and quantities as notified by WTO Members in Tables ES:1 and supporting Tables ES:2 (following templates in document G/AG/2 dated 30 June 1995).Data cover:• Notifications by WTO Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules;• Notifications of export subsidies by developing country Members pursuant to the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture.Other WTO Members are not entitled to use export subsidies and their notifications are therefore not recorded in the indicator series.Budgetary outlays and quantities are expressed in a currency (national or other) and in quantity units as per Member's notification practices. For Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules, the currency used in the notifications is similar to the one used in the Schedules.Data are available by country and by products or groups of products, according to Members' schedules for Members with export subsidy reduction commitments included in part IV of their Schedules and according to Member's notification practices in the case of developing country Members using export subsidies under the provisions of article 9.4 of the Agreement on Agriculture."""
26,Indicator2-c-1,Indicator of food price anomalies,"Definition:The indicator of food price anomalies (IFPA) identifies market prices that are abnormally high. The IFPA relies on a weighted compound growth rate that accounts for both within year and across year price growth. The indicator directly evaluates growth in prices over a particular month over many years, taking into account seasonality in agricultural markets and inflation, allowing to answer the question of whether or not a change in price is abnormal for any particular period.Concepts:The indicator of price anomalies (IFPA) relies on two compound growth rates (CGR’s), a quarterly compound growth rate (CQGR) and an annual compound growth rate (CAGR). A CGR is a geometric mean that assumes that a random variable grows at a steady rate, compounded over a specific period of time. Because it assumes a steady rate of growth the CGR smoothes the effect of volatility of price changes. The CGR is the growth in any random variable from time period  to , raised to the power of one over the length of the period of time being considered. 										(1)where: is the quarterly or annual compound growth rate in month tis the price at the beginning of the period is the price at the end of the period,  is the time in months between periods  and ."
27,Indicator3-1-1,Maternal mortality ratio,"Definition:The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy (proxied by a single live birth).Concepts:In the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems (ICD) WHO defines the following:Maternal death: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), but not from unintentional or incidental causes.A death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium (also known as a pregnancy-related death): The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death."
28,Indicator3-1-2,Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel,"Definition:Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives but can refer to other health professionals providing childbirth care) is the proportion of childbirths attended by skilled health personnel. According to the current definition these are competent maternal and newborn health (MNH) professionals educated, trained and regulated to national and international standards. They are competent to: (i) provide and promote evidence-based, human-rights based, quality, socio-culturally sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns; (ii) facilitate physiological processes during labour and delivery to ensure a clean and positive childbirth experience; and (iii) identify and manage or refer women and/or newborns with complications. "
29,Indicator3-2-1,Under-5 mortality rate,"Definition:The under-five mortality rate is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed as deaths per 1000 live births. Concepts:The under-five mortality rate as defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time), but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1000 live births. "
30,Indicator3-2-2,Neonatal mortality rate,"Definition: The neonatal mortality rate is the probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births.  Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life. "
31,Indicator3-3-1,"Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations","Definition:The number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations as defined as the number of new HIV infections per 1,000 persons among the uninfected population."
32,Indicator3-3-2,"Tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population","Definition:Tuberculosis (TB) incidence is defined as the estimated number of new and  relapse TB cases (all forms of TB, including cases in people living with HIV) arising in a given year. It is usually expressed as a rate per 100 000 population.Concepts:Direct measurement requires high-quality surveillance systems in which underreporting is negligible, and strong health systems so that under-diagnosis is also negligible; otherwise, indirect estimates are produced, using either a) notification data combined with estimates of levels of underreporting and under-diagnosis, b) inventory studies combined with capture-recapture modelling, c) population-based surveys of the prevalence of TB disease or d) dynamic models fitted to monthly/quarterly notification data. Dynamic models are only used for selected countries in which major drops in TB case notifications compared with pre-2020 trends suggest major reductions in access to TB diagnosis and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic."
33,Indicator3-3-3,"Malaria incidence per 1,000 population","Definition: Incidence of malaria is defined as the number of new cases of malaria per 1,000 people at risk each year. Concepts:A case of malaria is defined as the occurrence of malaria infection in a person in whom the presence of malaria parasites in the blood has been confirmed by a diagnostic test. The population considered is the population at risk of the disease. "
34,Indicator3-3-4,"Hepatitis B incidence per 100,000 population","Definition: This indicator is measured indirectly through the proportion of children 5 years of age who have developed chronic HBV infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a marker of infection called hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]).1   Hepatitis B surface antigen: a protein from the virus’s coat. A positive test for HBsAg indicates active HBV infection. The immune response to HBsAg provides the basis for immunity against HBV, and HBsAg is the main component of HepB.2  Concepts: It is not possible, on clinical grounds, to differentiate hepatitis B from hepatitis caused by other viral agents, hence, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. The Hepatitis B surface antigen is the most common hepatitis B test. The presence of HBsAg in serum indicates that the patient has contracted HBV infection. The measurement of HBsAg levels have been standardized in IU/ml. The test is used to identify those at risk of spreading the disease. HBsAg, an HBV viral coat antigen, is produced in large quantities in infected-cell cytoplasm and continues to be produced in patients with chronic, active HBV infection. Documented HBsAg positivity in serum for 6 or more months suggests chronic HBV with a low likelihood of subsequent spontaneous resolution. "
35,Indicator3-3-5,Number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases,"Definition:Number of people requiring treatment and care for any one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) targeted by the WHO NTD Roadmap and World Health Assembly resolutions and reported to WHO.Concepts:Treatment and care is broadly defined to allow for preventive, curative, surgical or rehabilitative treatment and care. In particular, it includes both: 1) Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as preventive chemotherapy (PC) for at least one PC-NTD; and2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other NTDs.Other key interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation."
36,Indicator3-4-1,"Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease","Definitions:   Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease.  Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases, defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who would die before their 70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDS). This indicator is calculated using life table methods (see further details in section 3.3).  Concepts: Probability of dying: The likelihood that an individual would die between two ages given current mortality rates at each age, calculated using life table methods. The probability of death between two ages may be called a mortality rate.  Life table: A table showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to a set of age-specific mortality rates.  Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases: ICD-10 underlying causes of death I00-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98. "
37,Indicator3-4-2,Suicide mortality rate,"Definitions:  The Suicide mortality rate as defined as the number of suicide deaths in a year, divided by the population, and multiplied by 100 000. Concepts:"
38,Indicator3-5-1,"Coverage of treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services) for substance use disorders","Definitions:The coverage of treatment interventions for substance use disorders is defined as the number of people who received treatment in a year divided by the total number of people with substance use disorders in the same year. This indicator is disaggregated by two broad groups of psychoactive substances: (1) drugs, (2) alcohol and other psychoactive substances.   Whenever possible, this indicator is additionally disaggregated by type of treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services). The proposed indicator will be accompanied, with contextual information on availability coverage, i.e. treatment capacity for substance use disorders generated at national level to provide additional information for interpretation of the contact coverage data.  Concepts: The central concept of “substance abuse” in the SDG health target 3.5 implies the use of psychoactive substances that, when taken in or administered into one's system, affect mental processes, e.g. perception, consciousness, cognition or affect. The concept of “substance use disorders” includes both “drugs use disorders” and “alcohol use disorders” according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10 and ICD-11).  The term “drugs” refers to controlled psychoactive substances as scheduled by the three Drug Control Conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988), substances controlled under national legislation and new psychoactive substances (NPS) that are not controlled under the Conventions, but may pose a public health threat. “Alcohol” refers to ethanol - a psychoactive substance with dependence producing properties that is consumed in ethanol-based or alcoholic beverages.   People with substance use disorders are those with harmful substance use and/or affected by substance dependence. Harmful substance use is defined in the ICD-11 as a pattern of use of substances that has caused damage to a person’s physical or mental health or has resulted in behaviour leading to harm to the health of others. According to ICD-11, dependence arises from repeated or continuous use of psychoactive substances. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use psychoactive substance, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences.  Treatment of substance use disorder -any structured intervention that is aimed specifically to a) reduce substance use and cravings for substance use; b) improve health, well-being and social functioning of the affected individual, and c) prevent future harms by decreasing the risk of complications and relapse. These may include pharmacological treatment, psychosocial interventions and rehabilitation and aftercare. All evidence-based used for treatment of substance use disorders are well defined in WHO and UNODC related documents.   Pharmacological treatment refers to interventions that include detoxification, opioid agonist maintenance therapy (OAMT) and antagonist maintenance (WHO, UNODC International Standards for the treatment of drug use disorders, 2016).   Psychosocial interventions refer to programs that address motivational, behavioral, psychological, social, and environmental factors related to substance use and have been shown to reduce drug use, promote abstinence and prevent relapse. For different drug use disorders, the evidence from clinical trials supports the effectiveness of treatment planning, screening, counselling, peer support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI), community reinforcement approach (CRA), motivational enhancement therapy (MET), family therapy (FT) modalities, contingency management (CM), counselling, insight-oriented treatments, housing and employment support among others. (UNODC WHO International Standards for the Treatment of Drug Use Disorders, 2016).  Rehabilitation and aftercare (Recovery Management and Social Support) refers to interventions that are based on scientific evidence and focused on the process of rehabilitation, recovery and social reintegration dedicated to treat drug use disorders.  "
39,Indicator3-5-2,Alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year in litres of pure alcohol,"Definitions:Harmful use of alcohol, defined according to the national context as alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year in litres of pure alcohol.  Total alcohol per capita (15+ years) consumption (APC) is defined as the total (sum of three-year average recorded APC and unrecorded APC adjusted for tourist consumption) amount of pure alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years), in a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol. Recorded alcohol consumption refers to official statistics at country level (production, import, export, and sales or taxation data), while the unrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). Tourist consumption takes into account tourists visiting the country and inhabitants visiting other countries. Positive figures denote alcohol consumption of outbound tourists being greater than alcohol consumption by inbound tourists, negative numbers the opposite. Tourist consumption is based on UN statistics, and data are provided by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Concepts:Recorded alcohol per capita (15+) consumption of pure alcohol is calculated as the sum of beverage-specific alcohol consumption of pure alcohol (beer, wine, spirits, other) from different sources. The first priority in the decision tree is given to government national statistics; second are country-specific alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on interviews or fieldwork (GlobalData (formerly Canadean), International Wine and Spirit Research (IWSR), Wine Institute; historically World Drink Trends) or data from the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV); third is the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' statistical database (FAOSTAT), and fourth is data from alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on desk review. For countries where the data source is FAOSTAT, the unrecorded consumption may be included in the recorded consumption. As for the beverage-specific categories, beer includes malt beers, wine includes wine made from grapes and vermouth, spirits include all distilled beverages, and other includes one or several other alcoholic beverages, such as fermented beverages made from sorghum, maize, millet, rice, or cider, fruit wine, fortified wine, etc. For unrecorded APC, the first priority in the decision tree is given to nationally representative empirical data; these are often general population surveys in countries where alcohol is legal. Second are specific empirical investigations, and third is expert opinion supported by periodic survey of experts at country level using modified Delphi-technique.  For recorded APC, if beverage volumes are not available in litres of pure alcohol, they are transformed into litres of pure alcohol. The alcohol content (% alcohol by volume) is considered to be as follows: beer (barley beer 5%), wine (grape wine 12%; must of grape 9%, vermouth 16%), spirits (distilled spirits 40%; spirit-like 30%), and other (sorghum, millet, maize beers 5%; cider 5%; fortified wine 17% and 18%; fermented wheat and fermented rice 9%; other fermented beverages 9%).Unrecorded APC is estimated using a regression analysis. Fractional response random intercepts regression models, which account for clustering of data points within countries, are used to estimate what percentage of total APC is due to unrecorded APC. Univariate models are fitted for alcohol consumption statistics and other predictors. The litres of alcohol consumed by tourists (15 years of age and older) in a country are based on the number of tourists who visited a country, the average amount of time they spent in the country, and how much these people drink on average in their countries of origin (estimated based on per capita consumption of recorded and unrecorded alcohol). Furthermore, tourist alcohol consumption also accounts for the inhabitants of a country consuming alcohol while visiting other countries (based on the average time spent outside of their country (for all people 15 years and older) and the amount of alcohol consumed in their country of origin). These estimations assume the following: (1) that people drink the same amounts of alcohol when they are tourists as they do in their home countries, and (2) that global tourist consumption is equal to 0 (and thus tourist consumption can be either net negative or positive). "

41,Indicator3-7-1,Proportion of women of reproductive age (aged 15–49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods,"Definition:The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) currently using a modern method of contraception among those who desire either to have no (additional) children or to postpone the next pregnancy. The indicator is also referred to as the demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods.Concepts:The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods is also referred to as the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods. The components of the indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) and unmet need for family planning.Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one method of contraception, regardless of the method used.For analytical purposes, contraceptive methods are often classified as either modern or traditional. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately.Unmet need for family planning is defined as the percentage of women of reproductive age who want to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any method of contraception. The standard definition of unmet need for family planning includes women who are fecund and sexually active in the numerator, and who report not wanting any (more) children, or who report wanting to delay the birth of their next child for at least two years or are undecided about the timing of the next birth, but who are not using any method of contraception. The numerator also includes pregnant women whose pregnancies were unwanted or mistimed at the time of conception; and postpartum amenorrheic women who are not using family planning and whose last birth was unwanted or mistimed. Further information on the operational definition of the unmet need for family planning, as well as survey questions and statistical programs needed to derive the indicator, can be found at the following website of the USAID Demographic and Health Surveys Program: http://measuredhs.com/Topics/Unmet-Need.cfm."

44,Indicator3-8-2,Proportion of population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income,"Definition:Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income. Two thresholds are used to define “large household expenditure on health”: greater than 10% and greater than 25% of total household expenditure or income. Concepts:Indicator 3.8.2 is defined as the “Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income”. In effect, it is based on a ratio exceeding a threshold. The two main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household expenditure on health (numerator) and total household consumption expenditure or, when unavailable, income (denominator). NumeratorHousehold expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at the time of service use to get any type of care (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care), including all medicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations, as well as all health products, from any type of provider and for all members of the household. These health expenditures are characterized by direct payments that are financed by a household’s income (including remittances), savings or loans but do not include any third-party payer reimbursement. They are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). They are the most inequitable source of funding for the health system as they are solely based on the willingness and ability to pay of the household; they only grant access to the health services and health products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity between the healthy and the sick beyond the household, the rich and the poor; they represent a barrier to access for those people who are unable to find the economic resources need to pay out of their own pocket. The components of household expenditure on health should be consistent with division 06 on the health of the UN Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) on medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient care services (06.2), inpatient care services (06.3) and other health services (06.4).Further information on definitions and classifications of health expenditures should be consistent with the International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA) and its family of classifications (for example, by type of provider). DenominatorExpenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary welfare measures. Household consumption is a function of permanent income, which is a measure of a household’s long-term economic resources that determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum of the monetary values of all items consumed by the household on a domestic account during a common reference period. It includes monetary expenditures on food and non-food non-durable goods and services consumed as well as the imputed values of goods and services that are not purchased but procured otherwise for consumption (value of in-kind consumption); the value use of durables, and the value use of owner-occupied housing. Information on household consumption is usually collected in household surveys that may use different approaches to measure ‘consumption’ depending on whether items refer to durable or non-durable goods and/or are directly produced by households.The most relevant measure of income is disposable income, as it is close to the maximum available to the household for consumption expenditure during the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as total income less direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally composed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services for own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, and transfers received as services. Income is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less variable over time and easier to measure. Therefore, it is recommended that whenever there is information on household consumption and income, the former is used (see the “comments and limitations” section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the denominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on consumption (see the section on data sources). ThresholdsTwo thresholds are used for global reporting to identify large household expenditure on health as a share of total household consumption or income: a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a higher threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25). With these two thresholds, the indicator measures financial hardship (see the section on comments and limitations).    "
45,Indicator3-9-1,Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution,"Definition:The mortality rate attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution can be expressed as: crude death rate or age-standardized death rate. Crude rates are calculated by dividing the brut number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years), while the age-standardized rates adjust for differences in the age distribution of the population by applying the observed age-specific mortality rates for each population to a standard population.Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important underlying causes of death taken into account in this estimate:- Acute lower respiratory infections (estimated in all age groups; ICD-10: J09-J22, P23, U04 );- Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years; ICD-10: I60-I69);- Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years; ICD-10: I20-I25);- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years; ICD-10: J40-J44); and- Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years; ICD-10: C33-C34).Concepts:The mortality resulting from the exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from polluting fuels used for cooking and/or heating was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all  these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health. By polluting fuels is understood kerosene, wood, coal, animal dung, charcoal, and crop wastes."
46,Indicator3-9-2,"Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) services)","Definition: The mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) services) as defined as the number of deaths from unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe WASH services) in a year, divided by the population, and multiplied by 100,000.   Concepts: Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on inadequate WASH services, expressed per 100,000 population; The included diseases are diarrhoea (GHE code 110 which includes ICD-10 codes A00, A01, A03, A04, A06-A09), acute respiratory infections (GHE code 380 which includes ICD-10 codes H65-H66, J00-J22, P23, and U04) intestinal nematode infections (GHE codes 340, 350 and 360 which include ICD-10 codes B76-B77, and B79) and protein-energy malnutrition (GHE code 550 which includes ICD-10 codes E40-E46).  "

51,Indicator3-b-3,Proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis,"Definition:Proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis.The indicator is a multidimensional index reported as a proportion (%) of health facilities that have a defined core set of quality-assured medicines that are available and affordable relative to the total number of surveyed health facilities at national level.Concepts:Indicator 3.b.3 is defined as the “Proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis”.This indicator is based on the proportion of facilities (pharmacies, hospitals, clinics,primary care centers, public/private, etc.) where core essential medicines from the identified set are available for purchase and their prices are affordable, compared to the total number of facilities surveyed.There are several core concepts that are used for measuring indicator 3.b.3:Availability of medicineAffordability of medicine→to define affordability, additional concepts are used:Daily dose treatment of the medicineNational poverty lineWage of the lowest paid unskilled government workerCore set of relevant essential medicines (defined on a global level)→to apply a core set of relevant essential medicines defined on a global level to all countries, an additional concept is used:global burden of disease1)A medicine is available in a facility when it is found in this facility by the interviewer on the day of data collection. Availability is measured as a binary variable with 1=medicine is available and 0=otherwise.2) A medicine is affordable when no extra daily wages (EDW) are needed for the lowest paid unskilled government sector worker (LPGW wage) to purchase a monthly dose treatment of this medicine after fulfilling basic needs represented by the national poverty line (NPL). Affordability is measured as a ratio of 1) the sum of the NPL and the price per daily dose of treatment of the medicine (DDD), over 2) the LPGW salary. This measures the number of extra daily wages needed to cover the cost of the medicines in the core set and that can vary between 0 and infinity.2.a) Daily dose of treatment (DDD) is an average maintenance dose per day for a medicine used for its main indication in adults.2 DDDs allow comparisons of medicine use despite differences in strength, quantity or pack size.2.b) National poverty line (NLP) is the benchmark for estimating poverty indicators that are consistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances. NPLs reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor.2.c) Wage of the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW is a minimum living wage that employees are entitled to receive to ensure overcome of poverty and reduction of inequalities.In other words, affordability of a medicine identifies how many (if any) extra daily wages are needed for an individual who earns the LPGW wage to be able to purchase a medicine. The computed EDW ratio aims to indicate whether the LPGW wage is enough for the individual who earns the lowest possible income to cover 1) the daily expenditures for food and non-food items used to define (relative or absolute) poverty using national standards (NPL) and 2) the daily needs for a medicine (DDD). This ratio then requires transformation into a binary variable where medicine is affordable when zero extra daily wages are required to purchase it and not affordable otherwise. 3)The core set of relevant essential medicines is a list of 32 tracer essential medicines for acute and chronic, communicable and non-communicable diseases in the primary health care setting.This basket of medicines has been selected from the 2017 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and used in primary health care. By definition, essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority health care needs of the population and are selected for inclusion on the Model List based on due consideration of disease prevalence, evidence of efficacy and safety, and consideration of cost and cost-effectiveness.These medicines are listed in table 1 of Annex 1, where a detailed justification for including each medicine is also provided, as well as online references for the relevant treatment guidelines and sections in the WHO List of Essential Medicines.This list of medicines is intended as a global reference. However, to address regional and country specificities in terms of medicine needs, the medicines in this basket are weighted according to the regional burden of disease.3.a) The global burden of disease is an assessment of the health of the world's population. More specifically, disease burden provides information on the global and regional estimates of premature mortality, disability and loss of health for causes. The summary measure used to give an indication of the burden of disease is the disability adjusted life years (DALYs), which represent a person’s loss of the equivalent of one year of full health. This metric incorporates years of life lost due to death and years of life lost through living in states of less than full health (or disability)."

The minimum proficiency level will be measured relative to new common reading and mathematics scales currently in development.Concepts:Minimum proficiency level (MPL) is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain (mathematics, reading, etc.) measured through learning assessments. In September 2018, an agreement was reached on a verbal definition of the global minimum proficiency level of reference for each of the areas and domains of Indicator 4.1.1 as described in the Minimum Proficiency Levels (MPLs): Outcomes of the consensus building meeting.Minimum proficiency levels defined by each learning assessmentTo ensure comparability across learning assessments, a verbal definition of MPL for each domain and levels between cross-national assessments (CNAs) was established by conducting an analysis of the performance level descriptors (PLDs) of cross-national, regional, and community-led tests in reading and mathematics. The analysis was led and completed by the UIS and a consensus among experts on the proposed methodology was deemed adequate and pragmatic.The global MPL definitions for the domains of reading and mathematics are presented in Table 1.Table 1.

58,Indicator4-2-2,"Participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official primary entry age), by sex","Definition:The participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official primary entry age), by sex is defined as the percentage of children in the given age range who participate in one or more organized learning programme, including programmes which offer a combination of education and care. Participation in early childhood and in primary education are both included. The age range will vary by country depending on the official age of entry to primary education.Concepts:An organized learning programme is one which consists of a coherent set or sequence of educational activities designed with the intention of achieving pre-determined learning outcomes or the accomplishment of a specific set of educational tasks. Early childhood and primary education programmes are examples of organized learning programmes. Early childhood and primary education are defined in the 2011 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011). Early childhood education is typically designed with a holistic approach to support children’s early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and to introduce young children to organized instruction outside the family context. Primary education offers learning and educational activities designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding core areas of knowledge and personal development. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialisation. The official primary entry age is the age at which children are obliged to start primary education according to national legislation or policies. Where more than one age is specified, for example, in different parts of a country, the most common official entry age (i.e. the age at which most children in the country are expected to start primary) is used for the calculation of this indicator at the global level."
59,Indicator4-3-1,"Participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non-formal education and training in the previous 12 months, by sex","Definition:The percentage of youth and adults in a given age range (15-24 years, 25-54 years, 55-64 years, 15-64 years) participating in formal or non-formal education and training in the previous 12 months.Concepts:Formal education and training is defined as education provided by the system of schools, colleges, universities and other formal educational institutions that normally constitutes a continuous ‘ladder’ of full-time education for children and young people, generally beginning at the age of 5 to 7 and continuing to up to 20 or 25 years old. In some countries, the upper parts of this ‘ladder’ are organized programmes of joint part-time employment and part-time participation in the regular school and university system.Non-formal education and training is defined as any organized and sustained learning activities that do not correspond exactly to the above definition of formal education. Non-formal education may therefore take place both within and outside educational institutions and cater to people of all ages. Depending on national contexts, it may cover educational programmes to impart adult literacy, life-skills, work-skills, and general culture."
60,Indicator4-4-1,"Proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology (ICT) skills, by type of skill","Definition:The proportion of youth and adults with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills, by type of skill defined as the percentage of individuals that have undertaken certain ICT-related activities in the last 3 months. The indicator is expressed as a percentage.
Concepts:The indicator on the proportion of individuals with ICT skills, by type of skills refers to individuals that have undertaken certain activities in the last three months. (Please note however, that until 2019 this data refer to computer-related activities and response categories, as explained below.)Computer-related activities to measure ICT skills are as follows:Copying or moving a file or folderUsing copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within a documentSending e-mails with attached files (e.g. document, picture, video)Using basic arithmetic formulas in a spreadsheetConnecting and installing new devices (e.g. a modem, camera, printer)Finding, downloading, installing and configuring softwareCreating electronic presentations with presentation software (including images, sound, video or charts)Transferring files between a computer and other devicesWriting a computer program using a specialized programming languageA computer refers to a desktop computer, a laptop (portable) computer or a tablet (or similar handheld computer). It does not include equipment with some embedded computing abilities, such as smart TV sets, and devices with telephony as their primary function, such as smartphones.Most individuals will have carried out more than one activity and therefore multiple responses are expected. The tasks are broadly ordered from less complex to more complex, although there is no requirement for a respondent to select simpler tasks before selecting a more complex task. From 2020, the data refer to skills irrespective of the device used.  The new skills categories are:Using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move data, information and content in digital environments (e.g. within a document, between devices, on the cloud)Sending messages (e.g. e-mail, messaging service, SMS) with attached files (e.g. document, picture, video)Using basic arithmetic formulae in a spreadsheetConnecting and installing new devices (e.g. a modem, camera, printer) through wired or wireless technologiesFinding, downloading, installing and configuring software and appsCreating electronic presentations with presentation software (including text, images, sound, video or charts)Transferring files or applications between devices (including via cloud-storage)Setting up effective security measures (e.g. strong passwords, log-in attempt notification) to protect devices and online accounts Changing privacy settings on your device, account or app to limit the sharing of personal data and information (e.g. name, contact information, photos)Verifying the reliability of information found onlineProgramming or coding in digital environments (e.g. computer software, app development)"

62,Indicator4-6-1,"Proportion of population in a given age group achieving at least a fixed level of proficiency in functional (a) literacy and (b) numeracy skills, by sex","Definition:The proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) and of adults (aged 15 years and above) who have achieved or exceeded a fixed level of proficiency in (a) literacy and (b) numeracy. Concepts:The fixed level of proficiency (FLP) is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain (literacy or numeracy) measured through learning assessments. Currently, the FLP for global reporting is the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) level 2 descriptor.The concepts of functional literacy and functional numeracy are based on the UNESCO definitions, which cover a continuum of proficiency levels rather than a dichotomy. A person is functionally literate if he/she can engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for the effective functioning of his/her group and community and also which enables them to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his/her own and the community’s development."
63,Indicator4-7-1,Extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment,"Definition:Indicator 4.7.1/12.8.1/13.3.1 measures the extent to which countries mainstream Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in their education systems. This is an indicator of characteristics of different aspects of education systems:  education policies, curricula, teacher training and student assessment as reported by government officials, ideally following consultation with other government ministries, national human rights institutes, the education sector and civil society organizations. It measures what governments intend and not what is implemented in practice in schools and classrooms. For each of the four components of the indicator (policies, curricula, teacher education, and student assessment), a number of criteria are measured, which are then combined to give a single score between zero and one for each component. (See methodology section for full details).The indicator and its methodology have been reviewed and endorsed by UNESCO’s Technical Cooperation Group on the Indicators for SDG 4-Education 2030 (TCG), which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the thematic indicator framework for the follow-up and review of SDG 4. The TCG also has an interest in education-related indicators in other SDGs, including global indicators 12.8.1 and 13.3.1. The TCG is composed of 28 regionally representative experts from UNESCO Member States (nominated by the respective geographic groups of UNESCO), as well as international and regional partners and civil society. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics acts as the Secretariat.Concepts:Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) nurture respect for all, build a sense of belonging to a common humanity, foster responsibility for a shared planet, and help learners become responsible and active global citizens and proactive contributors to a more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world. They aim to empower learners of all ages to face and resolve local and global challenges and to take informed decisions and actions for environmental integrity, economic viability and a just society for present and future generations, while respecting cultural diversity."

Internet is defined as a worldwide interconnected computer network, which provides pupils access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (i.e. not assumed to be only via a computer) and thus can also be accessed by mobile telephone, tablet, personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed narrowband, fixed broadband, or via mobile network.Computers for pedagogical use: Use of computers to support course delivery or independent teaching and learning needs. This may include activities using computers or the Internet to meet information needs for research purposes; develop presentations; perform hands-on exercises and experiments; share information; and participate in online discussion forums for educational purposes. A computer is a programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve and process data, as well as share information in a highly-structured manner. It performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations according to a set of instructions or algorithms. Computers include the following types:- A desktop computer usually remains fixed in one place; normally the user is placed in front of it, behind the keyboard;- A laptop computer is small enough to carry and usually enables the same tasks as a desktop computer; it includes notebooks and netbooks but does not include tablets and similar handheld devices; and- A tablet (or similar handheld computer) is a computer that is integrated into a flat touch screen, operated by touching the screen rather than using a physical keyboard.Adapted infrastructure is defined as any built environment related to education facilities that are accessible to all users, including those with different types of disability, to be able to gain access to use and exit from them. Accessibility includes ease of independent approach, entry, evacuation and/or use of a building and its services and facilities (such as water and sanitation), by all of the building's potential users with an assurance of individual health, safety and welfare during the course of those activities. Adapted materials include learning materials and assistive products that enable students and teachers with disabilities/functioning limitations to access learning and to participate fully in the school environment. Accessible learning materials include textbooks, instructional materials, assessments and other materials that are available and provided in appropriate formats such as audio, braille, sign language and simplified formats that can be used by students and teachers with disabilities/functioning limitations. Basic drinking water is defined as a functional drinking water source (MDG ‘improved’ categories) on or near the premises and water points accessible to all users during school hours.

67,Indicator5-1-1,"Whether or not legal frameworks are in place to promote, enforce and monitor equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex","Definitions:Indicator 5.1.1 measures Government efforts to put in place legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality.   The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. The assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women’s Machinery (NWMs), and legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 42 yes/no questions under four areas of law: (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and (iv) marriage and family. The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. As such, no new internationally agreed standard on equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex was needed. The primary sources of information relevant for indicator 5.1.1 are legislation and policy/action plans.The 42 questions in the questionnaire are:Area 1: Overarching legal frameworks and public lifePromoteIf customary law is a valid source of law under the constitution, is it invalid if it violates constitutional provisions on equality or non-discrimination? If personal law is a valid source of law under the constitution, is it invalid if it violates constitutional provisions on equality or non-discrimination? Is there a discrimination law that prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination against women? Do women and men enjoy equal rights and access to hold public and political office (legislature, executive, judiciary)? Are there quotas for women (reserved seats) in, or quotas for women in candidate lists for, national parliament?Do women and men have equal rights to confer citizenship to their spouses and their children?Enforce and monitor   Does the law establish a specialized independent body tasked with receiving complaints of discrimination based on gender (e.g., national human rights institution, women’s commission, ombudsperson)? Is legal aid mandated in criminal matters? Is legal aid mandated in civil/family matters?Does a woman’s testimony carry the same evidentiary weight in court as a man’s? Are there laws that explicitly require the production and/or dissemination of gender statistics?Are there sanctions for noncompliance with mandated candidate list quotas, or incentives for political parties to field women candidates in national parliamentary elections? Area 2: Violence against womenPromoteIs there legislation specifically addressing domestic violence?Have provisions exempting perpetrators from facing charges for rape if the perpetrator marries the victim after the crime been removed, or never existed in legislation? Have provisions reducing penalties in cases of so-called honor crimes been removed, or never existed in legislation?Are laws on rape based on lack of consent, without requiring proof of physical force or penetration? Does legislation explicitly criminalize marital rape or does legislation entitle a woman to file a complaint about rape against her husband or partner?Is there legislation that specifically addresses sexual harassment?  Enforce and monitorAre there budgetary commitments provided for by government entities for the implementation of legislation addressing violence against women by creating an obligation on the government to provide a budget or allocation of funding for the implementation of relevant programs or activities? Are there budgetary commitments provided by government entities for the implementation of legislation addressing violence against women by allocating a specific budget, funding, and/or incentives to support non-governmental organizations for activities to address violence against women? Is there a national action plan or policy to address violence against women that is overseen by a national mechanism with the mandate to monitor and review implementation? Area 3: Employment and economic benefitsPromoteDoes the law mandate non-discrimination based on gender in employment?Does the law mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value? Can women work in jobs deemed hazardous, arduous, or morally inappropriate in the same way as men?Are women able to work in the same industries as men?Are women able to perform the same tasks as men?Does the law allow women to work the same night hours as men? Does the law provide for maternity or parental leave available to mothers in accordance with the ILO standards? Does the law provide for paid paternity or parental leave available to fathers or partners?Enforce and monitorIs there a public entity that can receive complaints on gender discrimination in employment? Is childcare publicly provided or subsidized?Area 4: Marriage and familyPromoteIs the minimum age of marriage at least 18, with no legal exceptions, for both women and men?Do women and men have equal rights to enter marriage (i.e., consent) and initiate divorce? Do women and men have equal rights to be the legal guardian of their children during and after marriage? Do women and men have equal rights to be recognized as head of household or head of the family?Do women and men have equal rights to choose where to live?

Do women and men have equal rights to own, access, and control marital property including upon divorce?Enforce and monitor Is marriage under the legal age void or voidable?Are there dedicated and specialized family courts? Concepts: Article 1 of CEDAW provides a comprehensive definition of discrimination against women covering direct and indirect discrimination and article 2 sets out general obligations for States, in particular on required legal frameworks, to eliminate discrimination against women.  Article 1 of CEDAW states: “… the term ""discrimination against women"" shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field”. Article 2 of CEDAW states: States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake: (a) To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realization of this principle; (b) To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women; (c) To establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination; (d) To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation; (e) To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; (f) To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women; (g) To repeal all national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women”. The term “legal frameworks” is defined broadly to encompass laws, mechanisms, and policies/plans to ‘promote, enforce and monitor’ gender equality.  Legal frameworks that “promote” are those that establish women’s equal rights with men and enshrine non-discrimination based on sex. Legal frameworks that “enforce and monitor’ are directed to the realization of equality and non-discrimination and implementation of laws, such as policies/plans, the establishment of enforcement and monitoring mechanisms, and allocation of financial resources."
68,Indicator5-2-1,"Proportion of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months, by form of violence and by age","Definition:This indicator measures the percentage of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older who have been subjected to physical, sexual, or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner, in the previous 12 months. The definition of violence against women and girls (VAWG) and the forms of violence specified under this indicator are presented in the next section (Concepts).NOTE: References to “violence against women” (VAW) throughout also include adolescent girls (15-19 years old).Concepts:According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993), violence against women is “Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family […]”. See here for the full definition: https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104 Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation, or any other formal or informal union.The different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows: 1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to acts like pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling hair, slapping, kicking, biting, hitting with a fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. 2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone, whether by use of physical force, intimidation, or coercion. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts (intercourse) without consent (rape or attempted rape), non-contact acts such as being forced to watch or participate in pornography, etc. In intimate partner relationships, sexual violence is commonly operationally defined in surveys as being physically forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do or through coercion, and/or being forced to do something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading.3. Psychological violence consists of any act that induces fear or emotional distress. It includes a range of behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse such as being frequently humiliated in public, intimidated or having things you care for destroyed, etc. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners. In addition, surveys often measure controlling behaviours (e.g., being kept from seeing family or friends, or from seeking health care without permission). These are also considered acts of psychological abuse, although usually measured separately..     For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual, and psychological violence against women, see Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys (UN, 2014), and the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes ICCS (UNODC, 2015), and Violence against Women Prevalence Estimates, 2018.

See here for full definition: http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htmSexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. However, in most surveys that collect data on sexual violence against women and girls by non-partners the information collected is limited to forcing someone into sexual intercourse when she does not want to, as well as attempting to force someone to perform a sexual act against her will or attempting to force her into sexual intercourse. For a more detailed definition of sexual violence against women see Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys (UN, 2014)."

Informal unions are generally defined as those in which a couple lives together for some time, intends to have a lasting relationship, but for which there has been no formal civil or religious ceremony (i.e., cohabitation)."
71,Indicator5-3-2,"Proportion of girls and women aged 15–49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation, by age","Definition:Proportion of girls and women aged 15-49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation.This indicator can be measured among smaller age groups, with the experience of younger women representing FGM/C that has occurred more recently and the experience of older women representing levels of the practice in the past. At the regional and global level, this indicator is currently being reported as the proportion of adolescent girls aged 15-19 years who have undergone female genital mutilation.Concepts:Female genital mutilation (FGM) refers to “all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" (World Health Organization, Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation: An interagency statement, WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIFEM, OHCHR, UNHCR, UNECA, UNESCO, UNDP, UNAIDS, WHO, Geneva, 2008, p.4)"
72,Indicator5-4-1,"Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location","Definition:This indicator is defined as the proportion of time spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work by men and women. Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in the International Classification of Activities for Time-Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016) under the major divisions “3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members” and “4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members”.  Concepts:Unpaid domestic work refers to activities including food and meals management preparation,  cleaning and maintaining of own dwelling and surroundings, , do-it-yourself decoration, maintenance and repair of personal and household goods, care and maintenance of textiles and footwear, household management, pet care,  shopping for own household and family members and travel related to previous listed unpaid domestic services.Unpaid care work refers to activities related to  childcare and instruction,, care of the sick, elderly, or disabled household and family members, and travel related to these unpaid caregiving services.. Concepts and definitions for this indicator are based on the following international standards:International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016)System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008)The Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment, and labour underutilization, adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) at its 19th Session in 2013As much as possible, statistics compiled by UNSD are based on the International Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016), which classifies activities undertaken by persons during the survey period. ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission for use as an international statistical classification at its 48th session, 7-10 March 2017."
73,Indicator5-5-1,Proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments and (b) local governments,"Definition:The proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments, currently as of 1 January of reporting year, is currently measured as the number of seats held by women members in single or lower chambers of national parliaments, expressed as a percentage of all occupied seats.National parliaments can be bicameral or unicameral. This indicator covers the single chamber in unicameral parliaments and the lower chamber in bicameral parliaments. It does not cover the upper chamber of bicameral parliaments. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members, and by-election.Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates or the number of members of parliament.Concepts:Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, also known as the number of members of parliament. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members, and by-election."
74,Indicator5-5-2,Proportion of women in managerial positions,"Definition:This indicator refers to the proportion of females in the total number of persons employed in managerial positions. It is recommended to use two different measures jointly for this indicator: the share of females in (total) management and the share of females in senior and middle management (thus excluding junior management). The joint calculation of these two measures provides information on whether women are more represented in junior management than in senior and middle management, thus pointing to an eventual ceiling for women to access higher-level management positions. In these cases, calculating only the share of women in (total) management would be misleading, in that it would suggest that women hold positions with more decision-making power and responsibilities than they actually do.Concepts:-	Employment comprises all persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The difference between the 13th and 19th ICLS series for a given country is the operational criteria used to define employment, with two series based on the statistical standards from the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) and the other two series based on 19th ICLS standards. In the 19th ICLS series, employment is defined more narrowly as work done for pay or profit, while activities not done mainly in exchange for remuneration (i.e., own-use production work, volunteer work and unpaid trainee work) are recognized as other forms of work.-	Employment in management is determined according to the categories of the latest version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-08), which organizes jobs into a clearly defined set of groups based on the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. For the purpose of this indicator, it is preferable to refer separately to senior and middle management only, and to total management (including junior management). The share of women tends to be higher in junior management than in senior and middle management, so limiting the indicator to a measure including junior management may introduce bias. Senior and middle management correspond to sub-major groups 11, 12 and 13 in ISCO-08 and sub-major groups 11 and 12 in ISCO-88. If statistics are not available disaggregated at the sub-major group level (two-digit level of ISCO), then major group 1 of ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 can be used as a proxy and the indicator would then refer only to total management (including junior management)."
75,Indicator5-6-1,"Proportion of women aged 15–49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care","Definition:Proportion of women aged 15-49 years (married or in union) who make their own decision on all three selected areas i.e. decide on their own health care; decide on use of contraception; and can say no to sexual intercourse with their husband or partner if they do not want. Only women who provide a “yes” answer to all three components are considered as women who make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health. A union involves a man and a woman regularly cohabiting in a marriage-like relationship.Women’s autonomy in decision-making and exercise of their reproductive rights is assessed from responses to the following three questions:1.	Who usually makes decisions about health care for yourself?–	RESPONDENT –	HUSBAND/PARTNER–	RESPONDENT AND HUSBAND/PARTNER JOINTLY–	SOMEONE ELSE–	OTHER, SPECIFY 2.	Who usually makes the decision on whether or not you should use contraception?  –	RESPONDENT –	HUSBAND/PARTNER –	RESPONDENT AND HUSBAND/PARTNER JOINTLY–	SOMEONE ELSE–	OTHER, SPECIFY3.	Can you say no to your husband/partner if you do not want to have sexual intercourse?–	YES –	NO –	DEPENDS/NOT SUREA woman is considered to have autonomy in reproductive health decision making and to be empowered to exercise their reproductive rights if they (1) decide on health care for themselves, either alone or jointly with their husbands or partners, (2) decide on use or non-use of contraception, either alone or jointly with their husbands or partners; and (3) can say no to sex with their husband/partner if they do not want to."
76,Indicator5-6-2,"Number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education","Definition:Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 5.6.2 seeks to measure the extent to which countries have national laws and regulations that guarantee full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years and older to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education.  The indicator is a percentage (%) scale of 0 to 100 (national laws and regulations exist to guarantee full and equal access), indicating a country’s status and progress in the existence of such National laws and regulations. Indicator 5.6.2 measures only the existence of laws and regulations; it does not measure their implementation.  Concepts:Laws: laws and statutes are official rules of conduct or action prescribed, or formally recognized as binding, or enforced by a controlling authority that governs the behavior of actors (including people, corporations, associations, government agencies).  They are adopted or ratified by the legislative branch of government and may be formally recognized in the Constitution or interpreted by courts. Laws governing sexual and reproductive health are not necessarily contained in one law. Regulations: are executive, ministerial, or other administrative orders or decrees. At the municipal level, regulations are sometimes called ordinances. Regulations and ordinances issued by governmental entities have the force of law, although circumscribed by the level of the issuing authority.  Under this methodology, only regulations with the national-level application are considered.  Restrictions: many laws and regulations contain restrictions in the scope of their applicability. Such restrictions, which include, though are not limited to, those by age, sex, marital status, and requirement for third party authorization, represent barriers to full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education.  Plural legal systems: are defined as legal systems in which multiple sources of law co-exist. Such legal systems have typically developed over a period because of colonial inheritance, religion, and other socio-cultural factors. Examples of sources of law that might co-exist under a plural legal system include English common law, French civil or other law, statutory law, and customary and religious law. The co-existence of multiple sources of law can create fundamental contradictions in the legal system, which result in barriers to full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education.  “Guarantee” (access): for this methodology, “guarantee” is understood as a law or regulation that assures a particular outcome or condition. The methodology recognizes that laws can only guarantee “in principle”; for the outcomes to be fully realized in practice, additional steps, including policy and budgetary measures will need to be in place."
77,Indicator5-a-1,"(a) Proportion of total agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, by sex; and (b) share of women among owners or rights-bearers of agricultural land, by type of tenure","Definition:The indicator consists of two sub-indicators. Sub-indicator 5.a.1 (a):Sub-indicator 5.a.1 (a) is a prevalence measure. It measures the prevalence of people in the agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, disaggregated by sex. Land ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer land. “Secure rights” in the context of indicator 5.a.1 is defined as secure tenure rights, i.e., rights to use, manage and control land, fisheries and forests, in the sense of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security￼. Operationally, for the purposes of measurement of this indicator, secure tenure rights comprise both land ownership and two key alienation rights: the right to sell and the right to bequeath agricultural land.Sub-indicator 5.a.1 (b): Sub-indicator 5.a.1 (b) focuses on gender parity, measuring the extent to which women are disadvantaged in ownership or secure rights over agricultural land.Broad types of tenure identified by the IAEG-SDG are freehold, customary and leasehold.Concepts and terms:The basic concepts and terms essential to collecting data needed to compute SDG indicator 5.a.1 are the following:Agricultural landAgricultural householdAgricultural populationOwnership or secure rights over agricultural land(1) Agricultural landLand is considered ‘agricultural land’ according to its use. The classes and definitions of land use are based on the classification of land use for the agricultural census recommended by the World Programme for the Census of Agriculture 2020.As shown in Figure 1 below, agricultural land is a subset of the total land of a country. In particular, agricultural land includes:LU1- land under temporary cropsLU2- land under temporary meadows and pasturesLU3- land temporarily fallowLU4- land under permanent cropsLU5- land under permanent meadows and pasturesFigure 1. Classification of land use (WCA 2020)Since indicator 5.a.1 focuses on agricultural land, it excludes all the forms of land that are not considered ‘agricultural’, namely:LU6- land under farm buildings and farmyardsLU7- forest and other wooded landLU8- area used for aquaculture (including inland and coastal waters if part of the holding)LU9- other area not elsewhere classifiedThe land use class of agricultural land is with respect to a specific reference period; thus, the reference period should be specified when collecting data on land use. As further discussed below, the reference period should cover a 12-month period. In agricultural censuses and surveys, this is generally the preceding 12 months.(2) Agricultural householdOwnership or secure rights over agricultural land are specifically relevant to individuals whose livelihood relies on agriculture. These individuals are identified by way of whether their household can be classified as an agricultural household which for purposes of calculating indicator 5.a.1 is characterized by the following:Criterion 1: A member or members of the household operated land for agricultural purposes or raised livestock over the past 12 months regardless of the final purpose of productionandCriterion 2: At least one member of the household operated land for agricultural purposes or raised livestock as an own-account worker.The definition considers that since agricultural land includes both crop land (LU1-LU4) and meadows and pastures (LU5), ownership or secure rights over agricultural land are relevant for households operating land and/or raising or tending livestock. Engagement in forestry, logging, fishing and aquaculture activities is not included because the focus of the indicator is on agricultural land.Households who own or have secure rights over agricultural land but did not farm the land nor used the land in raising/tending livestock during the reference period are excluded, because the indicator focuses on households whose livelihood is linked to practicing agriculture.The long reference period-- previous 12 months-- allows to capture agricultural households even when data collection occurs during the off-season or when households are not engaged in agricultural activity at the time of the survey. That is, since agricultural work is highly irregular and strongly affected by seasonality, a short reference period would exclude such households.The specification “regardless of the final purpose of production” ensures the inclusion of households that produce only for own consumption. It addresses a common problem where agriculture practiced only or mainly for own consumption, without any market orientation (so, with no or little income) is not perceived as an economic activity by respondents.The second criterion for a household to be classified as an agricultural household for purposes of computing the sub-indicators 5.a.1(a) and 5.a.1(b) is that at least one household member farms or raises livestock as an own-account worker. Thus, information on the status in employment and, for those employed, the industry in which they are employed, and their occupation need to be collected for each member of the household.(3) Agricultural populationThe reference population for indicator 5.a.1 is the population of adult individuals living in agricultural households (as defined above). For purposes of international comparability, the recommended definition of “adult” is a person who is 18 years old or older. However, countries could use their own definitions of adult but allow for the calculation of statistics based on the 18-years old definition.Once a household is classified as an ‘agricultural household’, all the adult household members are considered as part of the reference population (to be referred to simply as the “agricultural population” in this document).The adoption of a household perspective is particularly important from the gender perspective, because in many agricultural households, women often consider themselves as not being involved in agriculture, even though they provide substantive support to the household’s agricultural activities. In addition, the individual’s livelihood cannot be completely detached from the livelihood of the other household members; and in particular, for households operating agricultural land or raising livestock, land is an important asset for all the individuals and protects them in case the household dissolves.When the data is collected in agricultural surveys or censuses, usually the statistical unit is the agricultural holding or farm.  The WCA 2020 classifies holdings into two types: (i) holdings in the household sector; i.e., those operated by household members and (ii) holdings in the non-household sector, such as corporations. For a given household sector holding, there may be one or more producers and the agricultural population is defined as the adult members of the households of the producers. It is important to note, that someone employed in the agricultural holding is not a producer. Holdings in the non-household sector are not relevant for the estimation of indicator 5.a.1.(4) Ownership of agricultural land and secure rights over agricultural landIt is challenging to operationalize the definition of ownership of and secure rights to agricultural land for purposes of data collection. In addition, differences in legal systems and how legal systems protect rights to agricultural land across countries poses challenges in providing comparable statistics across countries. The discussion below: Land ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer land. For purposes of specifying the data that needs to be collected, it is useful to recognize three broad typologies of land ownership systems:Private property systems, where land ownership is predominantly a right akin to a freehold tenure. Systems where land is owned by the State, where “land ownership” in the sense of private property systems does not exist but refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property system. In this context, it is more appropriate to speak of tenure rights that capture an individual’s capacity to control and take decisions over the land-- for instance, long-term leases, occupancy, tenancy or use rights granted by the State that are transferable and are granted to users for several decades (e.g., 99 years). Communal land tenure system, where land is primarily held under a tribal, communal, or traditional form of tenure. Such arrangements usually involve land being held on a tribal, village, kindred or clan basis, with land ownership being communal in character but with certain individual rights being held by virtue of membership in the social unit.In many countries, a combination of systems of ownership as well as secure tenure rights to land may exist. A common combination would be where the private property system prevails, but with pockets of state-owned and/or communal land. For some countries, the system may primarily be that of state-owned land or communal land.Considering the above, as well as the need for comparability of estimates across countries, to determine whether an individual is said to have ownership or secure rights to agricultural land three conditions (proxies) are considered:Formal documentation:Proxy 1-	Presence of legally recognised documents in the name of the individualAlienation rights:Proxy 2- Right to sellProxy 3- Right to bequeath These proxies are further described below.Formal documentationProxy 1 refers to the existence of any document that an individual can use to claim property rights before the law over an asset by virtue of the individual’s name being listed as owner/co-owner or holder/co-holder on the document. It is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of documents that could be considered as formal proof of ownership (for private property systems) or secure tenure rights (for state-owned or communal land systems) across countries. Examples of common relevant legal documents are provided in the discussion below. It is recommended that the list of documents be customised in accordance with land ownership laws of the country. It is further recommended that: Private property systemsFor private property systems, the following are typically considered as formal written proof of ownership:Title deed: “a written or printed instrument that effects a legal disposition”Certificate of occupancy or land certificate: “A land certificate is a certified copy of an entry in a land title system and provides proof of the ownership and of encumbrances on the land at that time”Purchase agreement: a contract between a seller and a buyer to dispose of landRegistered certificate of hereditary acquisitionCertificate issued for adverse possession or prescription: is a certificate indicating that the adverse possessor acquires the land after a prescribed statutory period.  It is to be noted that agricultural land possessed or used under a rental contract or leasehold is outside the coverage of indicator 5.a.1. Ownership of land confers on the holder a series of crucial benefits leading to economic empowerment - from being able to use it as collateral to having a higher propensity to invest in one’s own asset – these benefits are drastically reduced or even absent in the case of rentals or leases.Customary/communal land tenureFor land covered by customary tenure laws, the types of tenure and associated rights vary considerably. Thus, it is recommended that the list of relevant documents be prepared according to each country’s customary laws. An example of a relevant document is:Certificate of customary tenure: an official state document indicating the owner or holder of the land because customary law has recognized that particular person as the rightful owner. It can be used as proof of legal right over the land. These certificates include, among others, certificates of customary ownership and customary use.Systems where land is owned by the stateSimilarly, for state-owned land, associated formal documents of ownership-like possession should be specified according to the country’s land laws. An example of a relevant document is:Registered certificate of perpetual / long term lease: “a contractual agreement between the state and a tenant for the tenancy of land. A lease or tenancy agreement is the contractual document used to create a leasehold interest or tenancy” Note that findings from the Evidence and Data for Gender Equality (EDGE) project clearly show that using legally recognized documents alone to establish ownership is not sufficient to analyse the complexity of rights related to land, especially in developing countries and from the gender perspective. The main factor limiting the universal applicability of legally recognized documents to define ownership is the diverse penetration of such legally binding documents.Alienation rightsIn the absence of formal written documentation alienation rights over land, which can be present even in contexts where tenure rights are not formally documented, can serve as a proxy for ownership or secure rights. Alienation is defined as the ability to transfer a given asset during lifetime (Proxy 2- right to sell) or after death (Proxy 3- right to bequeath). The “right to sell” refers to the ability of an individual to permanently transfer the asset in question in return for cash or in-kind benefits. The “right to bequeath” refers to the ability of an individual to pass on the asset in question to other person(s) after their death, by written will, oral will (if recognized by the country) or when the deceased left no will, through intestate succession. The right to sell and the right to bequeath are considered as objective facts that carry legal force as opposed to a simple self-reported declaration of tenure rights over land.For purposes of data collection for 5.a.1, countries should clearly indicate whether these two alienation rights are relevant to the concept of land ownership in their legal contexts. This is particularly important in relation to land use under systems where land is owned by the state and customary/communal land.It is recommended that data on all three proxies be collected for purposes of compiling indicator 5.a.1. The decision to rely on the three proxies is based on the results of seven field tests conducted by the EDGE project. The tests demonstrated: The lower reliability of data on reported ownership/possession. Data on ownership/possession are often collected through a question on whether the individual owns any agricultural land. The data collected captures the self-perception of the respondent’s ownership or possession status of the land, irrespective of whether the respondent has formal documentation. The study showed that such data was often neither supported by any kind of documentation nor by the possession of any alienation right.The need to consider as ‘owners’ or ‘holders of tenure rights’ only the individuals who are linked to the agricultural land by an objective right over it, including both formal legal possession and alienation rights.The need to combine different proxies, as no single proxy is universally applicable in defining land ownership or secure tenure rights. A Note on “(Self) Reported Ownership/Possession of Agricultural Land”As mentioned above, reported ownership or possession is relatively less reliable than documented ownership. However, in a situation where a country has scarce data on formal documentation along with missing information on alienation rights, reported ownership could still be a temporarily useful alternative for comparing ownership between men and women. However, estimates computed based mainly on reported ownership weakens the international comparability of estimates across countries. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the survey questionnaire be modified in a manner that both documented ownership and alienation rights are included, as defined above, in order to calculate the indicator using the correct methodology. "
78,Indicator5-a-2,Proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women’s equal rights to land ownership and/or control,"Definition:Indicator 5.a.2 assesses the extent to which the national legal frameworks (including customary law) guarantee women’s equal rights to land ownership and/or control. The indicator “measures” the level to which a country’s legal framework supports women’s land rights, by testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and internationally accepted good practices , in particular the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ratified by 189 countries, and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of Land Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT) endorsed unanimously by Committee of Food Security (CFS) members in 2012.The six proxies through which indicator 5.a.2 is monitored are the following:Proxy A:  Joint registration of land is compulsory or encouraged through economic incentivesProxy B:  Compulsory spousal consent for land transactionsProxy C: Women’s and girls’ equal inheritance rightsProxy D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women’s ownership and control over landProxy E: In legal systems that recognize customary land tenure, the existence of explicit protection of the land rights of womenProxy F: Mandatory quotas for women’s participation in land management and administration institutionsConcepts:The indicator tracks progress on legal reforms that guarantee women’s land rights (including customary law) in terms of ownership and/or control. The customary dimension of the indicator is very important because in many contexts in which customary law prevails, women’s land rights tend to be denied or insecure. However, the enormous diversity of customs and social norms that govern customary land among and within countries and their unwritten nature, create a significant challenge for assessing whether the proxies are present in these systems. Therefore, the customary dimension will only be considered in the case it has been incorporated the legal system. Finally, the indicator refers to ownership and/or control of land which are two critical but different dimensions of women’s land rights. Land ownership refers to the legally recognized right to acquire, use and transfer land property, while control over land is associated with the ability to make decisions over land.Key definitions are the following:LandLand is defined as all immovable property – for instance the house, the land upon which a house is built and land which is used for other purposes, such as agricultural production. It also encompasses any other structures built on land to meet permanent purposes. Legal frameworks commonly use the terms ‘immovable property’ or ‘real property’ when referring to land.Land ownershipLand ownership is a legally recognized right to acquire, use and transfer land. In private property systems, this is a right akin to freehold tenure. In systems where land is owned by the state, the term “land ownership” refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property system – for instance, long-term leases, occupancy, tenancy or use rights granted by the state that are transferrable and are granted to users for several decades (for instance 99 years).Control over landControl over land is the ability to make decisions over land. It may include rights to make decisions about how the land should be used, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from the sale of crops. Customary land tenureCustomary land tenure is defined as the bodies of rules and institutions governing the way land and natural resources are held, managed, used and transacted within customary legal systems.Customary legal systemsCustomary legal systems are systems that exist at the local or community level, that have not been set up by the state, and that derive their legitimacy from the values and traditions of the indigenous or local group. Customary legal systems may or may not be recognized by national law. Legal and policy frameworkThe legal and policy framework comprises a set of publicly available legal and policy instruments governing land and family matters in force when conducting the assessment, including the Constitution, primary - and secondary legislation and policies. It includes customary legal systems where they have been recognized by statutory law. Personal laws Personal law is defined as a set of codified rules and norms applying to a group of people sharing a common religious faith about personal matters. These laws usually cover family relations, marriage, and inheritance. The term can be used interchangeably with ‘religious laws’.Primary legislation Primary legislation refers to (i) acts or statutes that have been formally adopted at the national level following the official parliamentary procedure for the passage of laws (in parliamentary systems); (ii) other acts at the national level with the force of law, such as decree-laws and legislative decrees and otherwise (in parliamentary systems); (iii) other legal instruments that have been formally endorsed by a law-making body, for instance presidential and royal orders or presidential and royal decrees (in non-parliamentary systems or systems where law-making power lies in an additional institution to the parliament). In all cases, primary legislation must have the force of law, be binding. For this assessment primary legislation includes the Constitution. Secondary legislationSecondary legislation includes subsidiary, delegated or subordinate legal instruments that have the force of law, are binding, and shall not be in contradiction with primary legislation. They are usually passed by the executive, such as national regulations, rules, by-laws, determinations, directions, circulars, orders, and implementing decrees.Joint registrationJoint registration is where the names of both spouses or both partners in an unmarried couple, are entered into the land registry as the owners or principal users of the land being registered. Joint registration signifies a form of shared tenure over the land – usually either a joint tenancy/occupancy or a tenancy in common). In legal systems which include a framework for land titling, joint registration is commonly referred to as joint titling.  Unmarried couplesUnmarried couples are defined as couples who live together (cohabit) in an intimate relationship, but who are not married following the marriage law of the country. It refers to couples who were married under custom or religious laws, where such marriages are not recognized or do not comply with the requirements of the formal law. It may also refer to relationships that are recognized by the state but that are not considered a marriage – for instance a civil partnership and a de facto relationship that is registered with the state. The term ‘unmarried couples’ is often used interchangeably with ‘de facto unions’, ‘consensual unions’ or ‘irregular unions’. The members of an unmarried couple are referred to as ‘partners’.Land transactionsLand transactions for the methodology are major land transactions, specifically the sale and encumbrance (mortgage) of land. InheritanceInheritance is defined as property passing at the owner's death to the heir or those entitled to succeed.Deceased’s estateThe deceased’s estate encompasses the legal rights, interests and entitlements, to property of any kind (not only land) which the deceased spouse or partner enjoyed at the time of death, less any liabilities. Depending on the legal system, marital property may be excluded fully from the calculation of deceased’s estate, or the deceased’s 50% share in the marital property will be included. Equal inheritance rights for sons and daughtersEqual inheritance rights for sons and daughters require the law on intestate inheritance to either be gender-neutral or provide for both an equal rank and equal shares in the inheritance for brothers and sisters (or daughters and sons)."
79,Indicator5-b-1,"Proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by sex","Definition:The proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by sex is defined as the ‘proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by sex’.Concepts:An individual owns a mobile cellular phone if he/she has a mobile cellular phone device with at least one active SIM card for personal use. Mobile cellular phones supplied by employers that can be used for personal reasons (to make personal calls, access the Internet, etc.) are included. Individuals who have only active SIM card(s) and not a mobile phone device are excluded. Individuals who have a mobile phone for personal use that is not registered under his/her name are also included. An active SIM card is a SIM card that has been used in the last three months.A mobile (cellular) telephone refers to a portable telephone subscribing to a public mobile telephone service using cellular technology, which provides access to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). This includes analogue and digital cellular systems and technologies such as IMT-2000 (3G) and IMT-Advanced. Users of both postpaid subscriptions and prepaid accounts are included."
80,Indicator5-c-1,Proportion of countries with systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment,"Definitions:Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 5.c.1 seeks to measure government efforts to track budget allocations for gender equality throughout the public finance management cycle and to make these publicly available. This is an indicator of the characteristics of the fiscal system. It is not an indicator of the quantity or quality of finance allocated for gender equality and women’s empowerment (GEWE). The indicator measures three criteria. The first focuses on the intent of a government to address GEWE by identifying if it has programs/policies and resource allocations for GEWE. The second assesses if a government has planning and budget tools to track resources for GEWE throughout the public financial management cycle. The third focuses on transparency by identifying if a government has provisions to make allocations for GEWE publicly available.The indicator aims to encourage national governments to develop appropriate budget tracking and monitoring systems and commit to making information about allocations for gender equality readily available to the public. The system should be led by the Ministry of Finance in collaboration with the sectoral ministries and National Women’s Machineries and overseen by an appropriate body such as Parliament or Public Auditors.Concepts: To determine if a country has a system to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment, the following questionnaire is sent to its Ministry of Finance, or agency in charge of the government budget:Criterion 1. Which of the following aspects of public expenditure are reflected in your government programs and its resource allocations? (In the last completed fiscal year)Question 1.1. Are there policies and/or programs of the government designed to address well-identified gender equality goals, including those where gender equality is not the primary objective (such as public services, social protection, and infrastructure) but incorporates action to close gender gaps? (Yes=1/No=0)Question 1.2. Do these policies and/or programs have adequate resources allocated within the budget, sufficient to meet both their general objectives and their gender equality goals? (Yes=1/No=0)Question 1.3. Are there procedures in place to ensure that these resources are executed according to the budget? (Yes=1/No=0)Criterion 2. To what extent does your Public Financial Management system promote gender-related or gender-responsive goals? (In the last completed fiscal year)Question 2.1. Does the Ministry of Finance/budget office issue call circulars, or other such directives, that provide specific guidance on gender-responsive budget allocations? (Yes=1/No=0)Question 2.2. Are key policies and programs, proposed for inclusion in the budget, subject to an ex-ante gender impact assessment? (Yes=1/No=0)Question 2.3. Are sex-disaggregated statistics and data used across key policies and programs in a way which can inform budget-related policy decisions? (Yes=1/No=0)Question 2.4. Does the government provide, in the context of the budget, a clear statement of gender-related objectives (i.e.  gender budget statement or gender responsive budget legislation)? (Yes=1/No=0)Question 2.5. Are budgetary allocations subject to “tagging” including by functional classifiers, to identify their linkage to gender-equality objectives? (Yes=1/No=0)Question 2.6. Are key policies and programs subject to ex-post gender impact assessment? (Yes=1/No=0)Question 2.7. Is the budget as a whole subject to independent audit to assess the extent to which it promotes gender-responsive policies? (Yes=1/No=0)Criterion 3. Are allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment made public? (In the last completed fiscal year)Question 3.1. Is the data on gender equality allocations published? (Yes=1/No=0)Question 3.2. If published, has this data been published in an accessible manner on the Ministry of Finance (or office responsible for budget) website and/or related official bulletins or public notices? (Yes=1/No=0)Question 3.3. If so, has the data on gender equality allocations been published in a timely manner? (Yes=1/No=0)Concept Definitions:For Criterion 1:“Programs or policies of the government, that are designed to address well-identified gender equality goals” can be defined as:Programs or policies that specifically target only women and/or girls. For example, a government program that provides scholarships for girls only, or a prenatal care program, or a National Action Plan on Gender Equality; orPrograms or policies that target both women or girls and men or boys and have gender equality as the primary objective. For example, a national public information campaign against gender violence, or on-the-job training programs on gender equality; orPrograms or policies where gender equality is not the primary objective, but the program includes action to close gender gaps. These programs could include the provision of infrastructure, public services, and social protection. For example, an infrastructure program that has a provision for using women’s labour, or a public transportation program that takes into consideration the mobility needs of women in its design. “Programs or policies have adequate resources allocated within the budget, sufficient to meet both their general objectives and their gender equality goals” can be defined as:The programs or policies that are designed to address well-identified gender equality goals are allocated sufficient resources to cover the costs of meeting those goals from funding that is included in the budget rather than from off-budget sources.“Procedures in place to ensure that these resources are executed according to the budget” can be defined as:There are procedures established in laws or regulations so that resources for programs or policies that are designed to address well-identified gender equality goals are executed as specified in the budget or if there are deviations in the exercise from the budgeted allocations, government agencies must justify to a supervising entity (e.g. ministries of finance, parliaments, audit bodies, or other relevant authorities) the reason for not executing resources according to budget.For Criterion 2:“Call circulars” can be defined as:Call circulars are the official notices that are issued by the Ministry of Finance or Budget Office in a country towards the beginning of each annual budget cycle. The circular instructs government agencies how they must submit their bids or demands for budget allocations for the coming year (in some countries the notice may have another name, such as budget guidelines or Treasury guidelines). It may inform each agency what its budget “ceiling” for the next fiscal year.“Key programs and policies” can be defined as:Programs or policies of the government, that are designed to address well-identified gender equality goals (as identified in Criterion 1).“Ex-ante gender impact assessment” can be defined as:Assessing individual resource allocations, in advance of their inclusion in the budget, specifically for their impact on gender equality. For example, before its inclusion in the budget, there is an estimate of how a conditional cash transfer program will impact school attendance of girls.“Sex-disaggregated statistics and data are available in a systematic manner across all key programs and policies” can be defined as:There is routine availability of gender-specific data sets and statistics that would greatly facilitate the evidential basis for the identification of gender equality gaps, design of policy interventions, and the evaluation of impacts.“Gender budget statements” can be defined as:A document that, either as part of the budget documentation or separately, provides a clear statement of gender-related goals. It is a document produced by a government agency, usually, the Ministry of Finance or Budget Office, to show what its programs and budgets are doing in respect of gender. It is generally prepared after government agencies have completed the process of drawing up the budget and allocating resources to different programs in response to the annual call circular.“Functional classifiers” can be defined as:Categorization of expenditure according to the purposes and objectives for which they are intended. A functional classifier on gender would identify expenditure that goes to programs or activities that address gender issues.“Ex-post gender impact assessment” can be defined as: Assessing individual resource allocations, after their implementation, specifically for their impact on gender equality. For example, once the resources are spent and the program executed, how did a conditional cash transfer program affect the school attendance rate of girls when compared to boys’ attendance rate?“The budget as a whole is subject to independent audit, to assess the extent to which it promotes gender-responsive policies” can be defined as:Independent, objective analysis, conducted by a competent authority different from the central budget authority, of the extent to which gender equality is effectively promoted and/or attained through the policies set out in the annual budget.For Criterion 3:“Published in an accessible manner” can be defined as:Allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment are published on the Ministry of Finance (or office responsible for budget) website and/or related official bulletins or public notices in a way that is clearly signalled and/or made available in hard copies that are distributed to parliamentarians and NGOs.“Published in a timely manner” can be defined as:Allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment and/or its exercise are published in the same quarter as when approved/exercised."
81,Indicator6-1-1,Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services,"Definition:The proportion of the population using safely managed drinking water services is defined as the proportion of population using an improved drinking water source which is accessible on premises, available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination. ‘Improved’ drinking water sources include: piped supplies, boreholes and tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, water kiosks, and packaged and delivered water. Concepts:The term ‘drinking water source’ refers to the point where people collect water for drinking and not the origin of the water supplied. For example, water collected from a distribution network that draws water from a surface water reservoir would be classified as piped water, while water collected directly from a lake or river would be classified as surface water.‘Improved’ drinking water sources include the following: piped water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, water kiosks, and packaged or delivered water. ‘Unimproved’ drinking water sources include: unprotected dug wells, unprotected springs, and surface water (rivers, reservoirs, lakes, ponds, streams, canals, and irrigation channels), all of which are by nature of their design and construction unlikely to deliver safe water.A water source is ‘accessible on premises’ if the point of collection is within the dwelling, compound, yard or plot, or water is delivered to the household.Drinking water is ‘available when needed’ if households report having ‘sufficient’ water, or water is available ‘most of the time’ (i.e. at least 12 hours per day or 4 days per week).‘Free from faecal and priority chemical contamination’ requires that drinking water meets international standards for microbiological and chemical water quality specified in the WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality. For the purposes of global monitoring the priority indicator of microbiological contamination is E. coli (or thermotolerant coliforms), and the priority chemical contaminants are arsenic and fluoride.For detailed guidance on water quality, please refer to the most recent version of the WHO Guidelines for drinking water quality:https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/water-sanitation-and-health/water-safety-and-quality/drinking-water-quality-guidelines "
82,Indicator6-2-1,Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water,"Definition:The proportion of the population using safely managed sanitation services is defined as the proportion of the population using an improved sanitation facility which is not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or removed and treated off-site. ‘Improved’ sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact. These include wet sanitation technologies such as flush and pour flush toilets connected to sewers, septic tanks or pit latrines, and dry sanitation technologies such as dry pit latrines with slabs, ventilated improved pit latrines and composting toilets.Concepts:An ‘improved sanitation facility’ is defined as one designed to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact. Improved sanitation facilities include wet sanitation technologies such as flush or pour flush toilets connected to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines; and dry sanitation technologies such as dry pit latrines with slabs (constructed from materials that are durable and easy to clean), ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines, pit latrines with a slab, composting toilets and container based sanitation. If a household uses a flush or pour flush toilet but does not know where it is flushed to, the sanitation facility is considered to be improved since the household may not be aware about whether it flushes to a sewer, septic tank or pit latrine. ‘Unimproved sanitation facilities’ include flush or pour flush toilets connected to open drains; pit latrines without slabs; open pits; buckets, pans, ‘trays’ or other unsealed containers; hanging toilets/latrines; defecation in the bush or field or ditch and defecation into surface water (drainage channels, beaches, rivers, streams or the sea). If a household uses a flush or pour flush toilet and survey respondents report that it is not flushed to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines but elsewhere, the sanitation facility is considered to be unimproved. Improved sanitation refers only to the type of facility used, irrespective of whether the facilities are shared. Public toilets, as well as privately owned sanitation facilities which are shared by two or more families, are classified as ‘shared facilities’. Use of improved sanitation facilities which are not shared is defined as a ‘basic sanitation service’, while use of improved sanitation facilities which are shared is defined as a ‘limited sanitation service’. ‘Basic sanitation services’ may also be counted as ‘safely managed sanitation services’, but additional information is required about the management of excreta.For monitoring of safely managed sanitation services, excreta from different types of sanitation facilities are tracked through stages of the ‘sanitation management chain’: containment, emptying, transport, treatment, and reuse or final disposal. These stages are followed separately for excreta flushed into sewer networks, and for excreta stored in on-site containers such as septic tanks and pit latrines.Excreta from on-site storage containers (pit latrines and septic tanks) can be treated and disposed of off-site, when faecal sludge is emptied from containers and delivered to treatment plants designed to receive faecal sludge. Excreta flushed into sewer networks can also be treated off-site, if the excreta reaches treatment plants and receives a minimum level of treatment. For the purposes of SDG monitoring, treatment of wastewater and faecal sludge is assessed based on the treatment plant design technology, using categories defined by the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) and the International Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a laddered approach (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment). Wastewater and faecal sludge receiving secondary or higher levels of treatment are considered ‘safely managed’. Primary treatment is not considered safely managed, unless the effluent is discharged in a way that precludes further human contact (e.g. through a long ocean outfall). If data are available for conventional classes (primary, secondary, tertiary, advanced) as well as for ambiguous categories (e.g. “other”), ambiguous categories are generally not considered as safely managed. Where treatment classes are not specified (e.g. “treated”) the JMP assumes at least secondary treatment but seeks clarification during country consultations. Treatment of excreta in faecal sludge treatment plants is classified as safely managed if both the liquid and solid fractions are treated.Excreta stored in on-site storage containers can be safely treated and disposed of on-site (‘safe disposal in situ’) if pit latrines and septic tanks are not emptied and excreta are contained (remain isolated from human contact) such that solids degrade within the container through physical and biological processes, and liquid effluent connects to an infiltration system such as a soakaway pit or leachfield. Faecal sludge emptied from septic tanks and pit latrines and buried on-site in a covered pit is also counted as safely disposed of in situ.

83,Indicator6-3-1,Proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater flows safely treated,"Definitions:This indicator measures the volumes of wastewater which are generated through different activities, and the volumes of wastewater which are safely treated before discharge into the environment. Both of these indicators are measured in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units that require conversion. The ratio of the volume treated to the volume generated is taken as the ‘proportion of wastewater flow safely treated’. Wastewater flows will be classified into industrial, services, and domestic flows, with reference to the  International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities Revision 4 (ISIC). To the extent possible, the proportion of each of these waste streams that is safely treated before discharge to the environment will be calculated.Concepts:Total wastewater generation and treatment can be quantified at the national level, and wastewater can also be disaggregated into different types of flows, based on ISIC categories. Domestic wastewater generated by private households, as well as wastewater generated by economic activities covered by ISIC categories, may or may not be pre-treated on premises before discharge to either the sewer for further treatment or directly to the environment, as shown in Figure 1.Figure 1: Schematic Representation of wastewater sources, collecting systems and treatment(modified from wastewater loading diagram, OECD/Eurostat 2018).The main sources of wastewater include wastewater from households, services and industries, i.e. point sources of one or more pollutant(s) that can be geographically located and represented as a point on a map. Diffused pollution from non-point sources such as runoff from urban and agricultural land can contribute quite significantly to wastewater flows (Figure 1), and therefore its progressive inclusion in the global monitoring framework will be important. Presently, it cannot be monitored at source and its impact on ambient water quality will be monitored under indicator 6.3.2 “Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality”. Differentiating between the different wastewater streams is important as policy decisions need to be guided by the polluter pays principle. However, wastewater conveyed by combined sewers usually combines both hazardous and non-hazardous substances discharged from different sources, but also runoff and urban stormwater, which cannot be separately tracked and monitored. As a consequence, although the flow of wastewater generated can be disaggregated by sources (domestic, services industrial), the treated  wastewater statistics are most commonly disaggregated by type (e.g. urban and industrial) and/or level of treatment (e.g. secondary) rather than by sources.Total wastewater flows can be classified into three main categories (see ‘disaggregation section’ for details:Industrial (ISIC divisions 05-35)Services (ISIC divisions 45-96)Domestic (private households)Wastewater treatment can be classified into three main categories (see ‘disaggregation section’ for details:PrimarySecondaryTertiaryWhere possible, treatment will additionally be classified into either on-premises or off-premises treatment. Domestic wastewater: Wastewater from residential settlements which originates predominantly from the human metabolism and from household activities.Industrial (process) wastewater: Water discharged after being used in, or produced by, industrial production processes and which is of no further immediate value to these processes. Where process water recycling systems have been installed, process wastewater is the final discharge from these circuits. To meet quality standards for eventual discharge into public sewers, this process waste-water is understood to be subjected to ex-process in-plant treatment. Cooling water is not considered here. Sanitary wastewater and surface runoff from industries are also excluded here.Total wastewater generated is the total volume of wastewater generated by economic activities (agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; and other economic activities) and households. Cooling water is excluded. Urban wastewater: Domestic wastewater or the mixture of domestic wastewater with industrial wastewater and/or runoff rain water. Wastewater: Wastewater is water which is of no further value to the purpose for which it was used because of its quality, quantity or time of occurrence. Cooling water is not considered here.Wastewater discharge: The amount of water (in m3) or substance (in kg BOD/d or comparable) added/leached to a water body (Fresh or non-fresh) from a point source.Wastewater treatment: Process to render wastewater fit to meet applicable environmental standards or other quality norms for recycling or reuse."
84,Indicator6-3-2,Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality,"Definition:The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality monitoring data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage. Concepts:The concepts and definitions used in the methodology have been based on existing international frameworks and glossaries (WMO, 2012) unless where indicated otherwise below.Aquifer: Geological formation capable of storing, transmitting and yielding exploitable quantities of water. Classification of water quality: If at least 80% of the monitoring values for prescribed parameters in a water body comply with their respective target values, the water body is classified as having a “good” water quality status. Each water body is classified as being of “good” or “not good” status. Groundwater: Subsurface water occupying the saturated zone. Groundwater body: A distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer or aquifers (EU, 2000). Groundwater bodies that cross river basin district (RBD) boundaries should be divided at the boundary with each separate portion of the groundwater body being reported separately along with its respective RBD. Lake: Inland body of standing surface water of significant extent. Non-point-source pollution: Pollution of water bodies from dispersed sources such as fertilizers, chemicals and pesticides used in agricultural activities.Parameter: Water quality variable or characteristic of water quality, also called a determinand.Point source pollution: Pollution with a precisely located origin.Pollution (of water): Introduction into water of any undesirable substance which renders the water unfit for its intended use.Pollutant: Substance which disrupts and interferes with the equilibrium of a water system and impairs the suitability of using the water for a desired purpose. Reservoir: Body of water, either natural or man-made, used for storage, regulation and control of water resources.River: Large stream which serves as the natural drainage for a basin.River basin: Geographical area having a common outlet for its surface runoff.River basin district:  Area of land, made up of one or more neighbouring river basins together with their associated groundwaters (EU, 2000).River water body: A coherent section of a river that is discrete (does not overlap with another water body) and is significant rather than arbitrarily designated. Stream: Flowing body of water in a natural surface channel.Surface water: Water which flows over, or lies on, the ground surface. Note: Indicator 6.3.2 does not include the monitoring of water quality in wetlands under monitoring level 1.Target value:  A value (or range) for any given water quality parameter that indicates the threshold for a designated water quality, such as good water quality rather than acceptable water quality.Toxic substance: Chemical substance which can disturb the physiological functions of humans, animals and plants.Transboundary waters: Surface or ground waters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between two or more States; wherever transboundary waters flow directly into the sea, these transboundary waters end at a straight line across their respective mouths between points on the low-water line of the banks (UNECE, 1992).Water quality index: The measured water quality results for all parameters combined into a numeric value for each monitoring location. These scores are then aggregated over the time of the assessment period. The index score can range between zero (worst) to 100 (best)."
85,Indicator6-4-1,Change in water-use efficiency over time,"Definition:Change in water use efficiency over time (CWUE): The change in the ratio of the value added to the volume of water use, over time.Water Use Efficiency (WUE) is defined as the value added of a given major sector divided by the volume of water used. Following the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities ISIC 4 coding , sectors are defined as:agriculture; forestry; fishing (ISIC A), hereinafter “agriculture”;mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; constructions (ISIC B, C, D and F), hereinafter “MIMEC”;all the service sectors (ISIC E and ISIC G-T), hereinafter “services”.Concepts:Water use: water that is received by an industry or households from another industry or is directly abstracted. [SEEA-Water (ST/ESA/STAT/SER.F/100), par. 2.21]Water abstraction: water removed from the environment by the economy. [SEEA-Water (ST/ESA/STAT/SER.F/100), par. 2.9]Water use for irrigation (km³/year) Annual quantity of water used for irrigation purposes.

It includes livestock watering, sanitation, cleaning of stables, etc. If connected to the public water supply network, water used for livestock is included in the services water use. [AQUASTAT Glossary]Water use for aquaculture (km³/year) Annual quantity of water used for aquaculture. It includes water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or abstraction of fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water.

[AQUASTAT Glossary]Water use for the MIMEC sectors (km³/year)Annual quantity of water used for the MIMEC sector. It includes water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or abstraction of fossil groundwater and use of desalinated water or direct use of (treated) wastewater. This sector refers to self-supplied industries not connected to the public distribution network. [AQUASTAT Glossary. To be noted that in AQUASTAT, the sectors included in the MIMEC group are referred to as “industry”]Water use for the services sectors (km³/year)Annual quantity of water used primarily for the direct use by the population. It includes water from renewable freshwater resources, as well as over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or abstraction of fossil groundwater and the use of desalinated water or direct use of treated wastewater. It is usually computed as the total water used by the public distribution network. It can include that part of the industries, which is connected to the municipal network. [AQUASTAT Glossary. To be noted that in AQUASTAT, the sectors included in “services” are referred to as “municipal”]Value added (gross)Value added is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. The industrial origin of value added is determined by the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), revision 4. [WB Databank, metadata glossary, modified]Arable landArable land is the land under temporary agricultural crops (multiple-cropped areas are counted only once), temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land under market and kitchen gardens and land temporarily fallow (less than five years). The abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data for “Arable land” are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is potentially cultivable. [FAOSTAT]Permanent cropsPermanent crops are the land cultivated with long-term crops which do not have to be replanted for several years (such as cocoa and coffee); land under trees and shrubs producing flowers, such as roses and jasmine; and nurseries (except those for forest trees, which should be classified under ""forest""). Permanent meadows and pastures are excluded from land under permanent crops. [FAOSTAT]Proportion of irrigated land on the total cultivated landTotal harvested irrigated crop area, expressed in percentage. Area under double irrigated cropping (same area cultivated and irrigated twice a year) is counted twice."
86,Indicator6-4-2,Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources,"Definition:The level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources is the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, after taking into account environmental flow requirements. Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, include agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry; and services. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity.Concepts:This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country’s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources. The terms “water resources” and “water withdrawal” are understood here as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal. Internal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation. External renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties. Total freshwater withdrawal (TFWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and services. It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, services (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries (including cooling of thermoelectric plants). Freshwater withdrawal includes fossil groundwater. It does not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. Environmental flow requirements (EFR) are defined as the quantity and timing of freshwater flows and levels necessary to sustain aquatic ecosystems, which, in turn, support human cultures, economies, sustainable livelihoods, and wellbeing.  Water quality and also the resulting ecosystem services are excluded from this formulation which is confined to water volumes. This does not imply that quality and the support to societies which are dependent on environmental flows are not important and should not be taken care of. Methods of computation of EFR are extremely variable and range from global estimates to comprehensive assessments for river reaches. For the purpose of the SDG indicator, water volumes can be expressed in the same units as the TFWW, and then as percentages of the available water resources."
87,Indicator6-5-1,Degree of integrated water resources management,"Definition:Indicator 6.5.1 is ‘degree of integrated water resources management implementation’. It measures the stages of development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), on a scale of 0 to 100, in six categories (see Rationale section). The indicator score is calculated from a country survey with 33 questions, with each question scored on the same scale of 0-100.  The definition of IWRM is based on an internationally agreed definition, and is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as “a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.” (GWP 2010). The method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992).Concepts:The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main sections, each representing key dimension of IWRM: Enabling environment: this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the ‘enabling environment’ for IWRM. Institutions and participation: includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM. Management Instruments: The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions. Financing: Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources.The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main sections. Each section is split into two parts: questions concerning the ‘National level’ and ‘Other levels’ respectively. ‘Other levels’ includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5 ‘implement [IWRM] at all levels …’."
88,Indicator6-5-2,Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation,"Definition:The indicator monitors the “transboundary basin” area within a country covered by an “operational” “arrangement for water cooperation”. A “transboundary basin” refers to a river or lake basin, or an aquifer system that marks, crosses or is located on boundaries between two or more states. A basin comprises the entire catchment area of a surface water body (river or lake), or for groundwater, the area of the aquifer, i.e. the entire permeable water-bearing geological formation. For the purpose of calculating the value of SDG indicator 6.5.2 the transboundary basin area is the extent of the catchment area (river or lake basin); or the extent of the aquifer. “Arrangement for water cooperation” refers to a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other formal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding between countries sharing transboundary basins that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kinds of formal arrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional authorities. “Operational” means that an agreement for cooperation between the countries sharing transboundary basins meets all the following four criteria: - There is a joint body or mechanism (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary cooperation;- There are regular, i.e., at least annual, formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings (either at the political and/or technical level);- There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set;- There is a regular, i.e., at least annual, exchange of data and information.Concepts:The monitoring has as its basis the spatial coverage of transboundary basins shared by each country, and focuses on monitoring whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are “operational”. The criteria to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin to be considered “operational” seek to capture whether the arrangement(s) provides the basic elements needed to allow that arrangement to implement cooperation in water management."
89,Indicator6-6-1,Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time,"Definition:Indicator 6.6.1 tracks the extent to which different types of water-related ecosystems are changing in extent over time. The indicator is multifaceted capturing data on different types of freshwater ecosystems and to measure extent change the indicator considers spatial area changes, water quality   and water quantity changes. The indicator uses satellite-based Earth observations to globally monitor different freshwater ecosystems types. Earth observation data series on surface area are available on permanent water, seasonal water, reservoirs, wetlands, mangroves; as well as generating data on water quality, using trophic state and turbidity of water bodies. Satellite images can be represented as numerical data, which in turn are aggregated into meaningful statistics of ecosystem change attributed to administrative areas such as national, sub-national (e.g. regions and provinces) and river basin boundaries. Global data products for river flows and groundwater level have not yet been produced at useful spatial and temporal resolutions to be incorporated into this SDG 6.6.1 methodology. Currently, these data should continue to be provided from modelling or from ground-based measurements and required from the countries.Concepts:The concepts and definitions used in the methodology have been based on existing international frameworks and glossaries unless where indicated otherwise below.Water-related ecosystems are a sub-set of all ecosystems. They contain the world’s freshwater resources and can be defined as “a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and micro-organism communities and the non-living environment dominated by the presence of flowing or still water, interacting as a functional unit.” (MEA, 2005; Dickens et al, 2019).  The indicator is framed around the monitoring of different types of water-related ecosystems including lakes, rivers, wetlands, groundwater and artificial waterbodies such as reservoirs. These water-related ecosystems contain freshwater, except for mangroves which contain brackish water (i.e. a combination of fresh and saltwater), however, mangroves are still included within indicator 6.6.1. Reservoirs are also included as a category of water-related ecosystem within the indicator methodology; while it is recognized that reservoirs are not traditional water ecosystems which should necessarily warrant protection and restoration, in many countries they hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. By including data on reservoirs, it is intended that countries can better understand changes occurring to artificial water bodies in conjunction with changes occurring to natural water bodies. Ecosystems that are not included under indicator 6.6.1 are: coral reefs and sea grass which are covered within Goal 14 (Oceans); and mountains, forests, and drylands which are covered within Goal 15 (Land). The extent to which each of the water-related ecosystems included under indicator 6.6.1 can be measured, uses one or more of the following physical parameters of change: spatial area, quantity (or volume) of water, and water quality. The full monitoring methodology for indicator 6.6.1 is available here. The extent to which each of the water-related ecosystems included under indicator 6.6.1 can be measured, uses one or more of the following physical parameters of change: spatial area, quantity (or volume) of water, and water quality.Inland vegetated wetlands include areas of marshes, peatlands, swamps, bogs and fens, the vegetated parts of floodplains as well as rice paddies and flood recession agriculture. Inland vegetated wetlands do not include coastal mangroves. Data on mangroves which are produced separately to inland wetlands. This SDG indicator methodology is used for official reporting of SDG indicator 6.6.1 statistics. The SDG indicator 6.6.1 methodology does not apply the definition of wetlands defined by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which is: “areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters”. The Ramsar definition of wetlands may be interpreted to mean all water within a country including the marine environment. The SDG indicator 6.6.1 definition refers to only a specific group of inland vegetated wetlands typologies.Permanent and seasonal water. A permanent water surface is underwater throughout the year whilst a seasonal water surface is underwater for less than 12 months of the year. Some locations don’t have observations for all 12 months of the year (for reasons such as polar night). In these cases, water is considered as seasonal if the number of months where water is present is less than the number of months where valid observations were acquired.A second consideration is lakes and rivers that freeze for part of the year. During the frozen period water is still present under the ice (true both for rivers/lakes and the sea). If water is present throughout the observation period (i.e. unfrozen period), the water body is considered as a permanent water surface. If the area of the water body contracts during the unfrozen period, then the pixels along the borders of the lake or river are no longer water, and those pixels will be considered as a seasonal water surface.Reservoirs are artificial (or human-made) bodies of freshwater, as opposed to lakes which are naturally occurring. The reservoirs dataset represents surface area data on artificial water bodies including reservoirs formed by dams, flooded areas such as opencast mines and quarries, flood irrigation areas, and water bodies created by hydro-engineering projects such as waterway and harbour construction.Turbidity is an indicator of water clarity, quantifying the haziness of the water and acting as an indicator of underwater light availability.Trophic State refers to the degree at which organic matter accumulates in the water body and is most commonly used in relation to monitoring eutrophication.Surface Water refers to any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. This includes the following 3 water-related ecosystem categories: rivers and estuaries, lakes, and artificial waterbodies.Extent – has been expanded beyond spatial extent to capture additional basic parameters needed for the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems. Extent includes three components: the spatial extent or surface area, the quality, and the quantity of water-related ecosystems. Change means a shift from one condition of extent to another over time within a water-related ecosystem, measured against a point of reference.Permanent and seasonal water concept definitions and data resolutionData on the spatial and temporal dynamics of naturally occurring surface water has been generated for the entire globe.  A Global Surface Water dataset (Pekel et al., 2016) has been produced by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. The dataset documents different facets of the long term (since 1984 onward) water dynamics at 30x30 meter pixel resolution. The dataset documents permanent and seasonal surface water surfaces. All naturally occurring surface water larger in area than 30x30 meters has been mapped and at this 30-meter grid/pixel spatial resolution satellite imagery is predominantly capturing areas of lakes and wide rivers (ie.. rivers over 30meters wide). The data include land areas that are temporarily inundated. Smaller rivers and waterbodies are not captured as they are too narrow to detect or are masked by forest canopy. The data include individual full-resolution images acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 and Sentinel 1 satellites. These satellites capture images which are distributed publicly by the United States Geological Survey and by the European Union’s Copernicus space programme. Together they provide multispectral imagery at 30x30 meter resolution in six visible, near and shortwave infrared channels, plus thermal imagery at 60x60 meters. The data includes land surfaces that are under water (e.g. a permanent water area) for all twelve months of a year. It also accounts for seasonal and climactic fluctuations of water, meaning lakes and rivers which freeze for part of the year are captured. Areas of permanent ice, such as glaciers and ice caps as well as permanently snow-covered land areas are not included. Areas of consistent cloud cover inhibit the observation of water surfaces in some areas and in these limited locations optical observations may not be available. A global shoreline mask has been applied to the data to prevent ocean water being included in the freshwater statistics and the methodology for this shoreline mask is published in the journal of operational oceanography, available here (Sayer et al. 2019).The accuracy of the Global Surface Water map was determined using over 40,000 control points from around the world and across the 36 years. The full validation methodology and results have been published in the scientific journal Nature, available here, (Pekel et al., 2016). The validation results show that the water detection expert system produced less than 1% of false water detections, and that less than 5% of water surfaces were missed. The provided maps are derived from the analysis of over four million images collected over 36 years which have been individually processed using an accurate expert system classifier.The SDG 6.6.1 data portal (www.sdg661.app) documents various water transitions relating to permanent and seasonal surface water - these are changes in water state between two points in time (e.g. 2000 - 2019). Data is available for various transitions including new permanent water surfaces (i.e. conversion of a no water place into a permanent water place.); lost permanent water surfaces (i.e. conversion of a permanent water place into a no water place) as well as new and lost seasonal water. These allow monthly water presence or absence data to be captured. It is possible to identify specific months/years in which conditions changed, e.g. the date of filing of a new dam, or the month/year in which a lake disappeared. In addition, data on seasonality are provided, capturing changes resulting from intra and inter-annual variability or resulting from appearance or disappearance of seasonal or permanent water surfaces. The data separates 'permanent' water bodies (those that are present throughout the period of observation) [nominally a year] from 'seasonal' (those that are present for only part of the year)."
90,Indicator6-a-1,Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan,"Definition:Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan is defined as the proportion of total water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) disbursements that are included in the government budget.Concepts:“International cooperation and capacity-building support” implies aid (most of it quantifiable) in the form of grants or loans by external support agencies. The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) can be used as a proxy for this, captured by OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS). ODA is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (“bilateral ODA”) and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts, from a recipient perspective, comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies—with the pure purpose of export promotion—is excluded (see http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm).“Developing countries” refer to countries, which are eligible to receive official development assistance (see http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm). This limits the scope of reporting to those countries receiving water and sanitation ODA, and the number of such countries is expected to decrease going forward.Water and sanitation-related activities and programmes include those for water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (targets 6.1, 6.2), wastewater and water quality (6.3), water efficiency (6.4), water resource management (6.5), and water-related ecosystems (6.6). As per target 6.a wording, it includes activities and programmes for water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. A government coordinated spending plan is defined as a financing plan/budget for the water and sanitation sector, clearly assessing the available sources of finance and strategies for financing future needs."
91,Indicator6-b-1,Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management,"Definition:The indicator assesses the percentage of local administrative units (as defined by the national government) that have an established and operational mechanism by which individuals and communities can meaningfully contribute to decisions and directions about water and sanitation management.The indicator Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management is currently being measured by the Proportion of countries with clearly defined procedures in law or policy for participation by service users/communities in planning program in water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion and the Proportion of countries with high level of users/communities participating in planning programs in water and sanitation management, and hygiene promotion.Concepts:Stakeholder participation is essential to ensure the sustainability of water and sanitation management options over time, e.g. the choice of appropriate solutions for a given social and economic context, and the full understanding of the impacts of a certain development decision. Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital to ensure needs of all the community is met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability.Local administrative units refers to non-overlapping sub-districts, municipalities, communes, or other local community-level units covering both urban and rural areas to be defined by the government. Policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management would define a formal mechanism to ensure participation of users in planning water and sanitation activities. A policy or procedure is considered to be established if the mechanism for participation of local communities is defined in law or has been formally approved and published. It is considered to be operational if the policy or procedure is being implemented, with appropriate funding in place and with means for verifying that participation took place.‘Water and sanitation’ includes all areas of management related to each of the targets under SDG 6, namely: water supply (6.1), sanitation and hygiene (6.2), wastewater treatment and ambient water quality (6.3), efficiency and sustainable use (6.4), integrated water resources management (6.5) and water-related ecosystems (6.6)."
92,Indicator7-1-1,Proportion of population with access to electricity,"Definition:Proportion of population with access to electricity is the percentage of population with access to electricity.SDG7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Specifically, Indicator 7.1.1 refers to the proportion of population with access to electricity. This is expressed in percentage figures and is disaggregated by total, urban and rural access rates per country, as well as by UN regional and global classifications. Concepts:Electricity access in this scenario refers to the proportion of population in the considered area (country, region, and global context) that has access to consistent sources of electricity. The World Bank’s Global Electrification Database compiles nationally representative household survey data as well as census data since 1990. It also incorporates data from the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa Poverty Database, and the Europe and Central Asia Poverty Database, all of which are based on similar surveys. "
93,Indicator7-1-2,Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology,"Definition:Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting that any cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage. “Clean” is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion.Concepts:Current global data collection focuses on the primary fuel used for cooking, categorized as solid or non-solid fuels, where solid fuels are considered polluting and non-modern, while non-solid fuels are considered clean. This single measure captures a good part of the lack of access to clean cooking fuels but fails to collect data on type of device or technology used for cooking, and fails to capture other polluting forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and heating.New evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO (i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately protecting public health. These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and discourage the use of kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home. They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. cooking, space heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology combinations to ensure health benefits.For this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines, access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as “access to clean fuels and technologies” rather than “access to non-solid fuels.” This shift will help ensure that health and other “nexus” benefits are better counted, and thus realized."
94,Indicator7-2-1,Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption,"Definition:The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources.Concepts:Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from: hydro, wind, solar, solid biofuels, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and renewable waste. Total final energy consumption is calculated from balances as total final consumption minus non-energy use. Comments regarding specific renewable energy sources: Solar energy includes solar PV and solar thermal. Liquid biofuels include biogasoline, biodiesels and other liquid biofuels. Solid biofuels include fuelwood, animal waste, vegetable waste, black liquor, bagasse and charcoal. Renewable waste energy covers energy from renewable municipal waste."
95,Indicator7-3-1,Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP,"Definition: Energy intensity is defined as the energy supplied to the economy per unit value of economic output.Concepts: Total energy supply, as defined by the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES), is made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the measure of economic output. For international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity."
96,Indicator7-a-1,"International financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems","Definition:The flows are covered through two complementary sources.OECD: The flows covered by the OECD are defined as all official loans, grants and equity investments received by countries on the DAC List of ODA Recipients from foreign governments and multilateral agencies, for the purpose of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems extracted from the OECD/DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS) with the following sector codes:•	23210 Energy generation, renewable sources – multiple technologies - Renewable energy generation programmes that cannot be attributed to one single technology (codes 23220 through 23280 below). Fuelwood/charcoal production should be included under forestry 31261. •	23220 Hydro-electric power plants - Including energy generating river barges. •	23230 Solar energy for centralised grids  •	23231 Solar energy for isolated grids and standalone systems•	23232 Solar energy – thermal applications•	23240 Wind energy - Wind energy for water lifting and electric power generation. •	23250 Marine energy - Including ocean thermal energy conversion, tidal and wave power. •	23260 Geothermal energy - Use of geothermal energy for generating electric power or directly as heat for agriculture, etc. •	23270- Biofuel-fired power plants Use of solids and liquids produced from biomass for direct power generation. Also includes biogases from anaerobic fermentation (e.g. landfill gas, sewage sludge gas, fermentation of energy crops and manure) and thermal processes (also known as syngas); waste fired power plants making use of biodegradable municipal waste (household waste and waste from companies and public services that resembles household waste, collected at installations specifically designed for their disposal with recovery of combustible liquids, gases or heat). See code 23360 for non-renewable waste-fired power plants.•	23410 Hybrid energy electric power plants•	23631 Electric power transmission and distribution (isolated mini-grids) Research and development of energy efficiency technologies and measures is captured under CRS sector code 23182 on Energy research. The above flows also include technical assistance provided to support production, research and development as defined above.IRENA: The flows covered by IRENA are defined as all additional loans, grants and equity investments received by developing countries (defined as countries in developing regions, as listed in the UN M49 composition of regions) from all foreign governments, multilateral agencies and additional development finance institutions (including export credits, where available) for the purpose of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems. These additional flows cover the same technologies and other activities (research and development, technical assistance, etc.) as listed above and exclude all flows extracted from the OECD/DAC CRS."
97,Indicator7-b-1,Installed renewable energy-generating capacity in developing countries (in watts per capita),"Definition:The indicator is defined as the installed capacity of power plants that generate electricity from renewable energy sources divided by the total population of a country. Capacity is defined as the net maximum electrical capacity installed at the year-end and renewable energy sources are as defined in the IRENA Statute (see concepts below).Concepts:Electricity capacity is defined in the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics or IRES (UN, 2018) as the maximum active power that can be supplied continuously (i.e., throughout a prolonged period in a day with the whole plant running) at the point of outlet (i.e., after taking the power supplies for the station auxiliaries and allowing for the losses in those transformers considered integral to the station). This assumes no restriction of interconnection to the network. It does not include overload capacity that can only be sustained for a short period of time (e.g., internal combustion engines momentarily running above their rated capacity).The IRENA Statute defines renewable energy to include energy from the following sources: hydropower; marine energy (ocean, tidal and wave energy); wind energy; solar energy (photovoltaic and thermal energy); bioenergy; and geothermal energy."
98,Indicator8-1-1,Annual growth rate of real GDP per capita,Annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is calculated as the percentagechange in the real GDP per capita between two consecutive years. Real GDP per capita is calculated bydividing GDP at constant prices by the population of a country or area. The data for real GDP aremeasured in constant US dollars to facilitate the calculation of country growth rates and aggregation ofthe country data.
99,Indicator8-2-1,Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person,"Definition: The annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per employed person conveys the annual percentage change in real GDP per employed person.  Concepts: GDP: It is the main measure of national output, representing the total value of all final goods and services within the System of National Accounts (SNA) production boundary produced in a particular economy (that is, the dollar value of all goods and services within the SNA production boundary produced within a country’s borders in a given year). According to the SNA, “GDP is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of output … GDP is also equal to the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers’ prices, less the value of imports of goods and services GDP is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units.”  Real GDP: Real GDP refers to GDP calculated at constant prices, that is, the volume level of GDP, excluding the effect of inflation and favouring comparisons of quantities beyond price changes. Constant price estimates of GDP are calculated by expressing values in terms of a base period. In theory, the price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the current period.  Employment: All persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. "
100,Indicator8-3-1,"Proportion of informal employment in total employment, by sector and sex","Definition:This indicator presents the share of employment which is classified as informal employment in the total economy, and separately in agriculture and in non-agriculture.Concepts:Employment comprises all persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The difference between the two series for a given country is the operational criteria used to define employment, with one series based on the statistical standards from the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) and the other series based on 19th ICLS standards. In the 19th ICLS series, employment is defined more narrowly as work done for pay or profit, while activities not done mainly in exchange for remuneration (i.e., own-use production work, volunteer work and unpaid trainee work) are recognized as other forms of work.Informal employment comprises persons who in their main or secondary jobs were in one of the following categories:- Own-account workers, employers and members of producers’ cooperatives employed in their own informal sector enterprises (the characteristics of the enterprise determine the informal nature of their jobs)- Own-account workers engaged in the production of goods exclusively for own final use by their household (e.g. subsistence farming)- Contributing family workers, regardless of whether they work in formal or informal sector enterprises (they usually do not have explicit, written contracts of employment, and are not subject to labour legislation, social security regulations, collective agreements, etc., which determines the informal nature of their jobs)- Employees holding informal jobs, whether employed by formal sector enterprises, informal sector enterprises, or as paid domestic workers by households (employees are considered to have informal jobs if their employment relationship is, in law or in practice, not subject to national labour legislation, income taxation, social protection or entitlement to certain employment benefits)For the purpose of classifying persons into formal or informal employment for this indicator, only the characteristics of the main job are considered. An enterprise belongs to the informal sector if it fulfils the three following conditions:- It is an unincorporated enterprise (it is not constituted as a legal entity separate from its owners, and it is owned and controlled by one or more members of one or more households, and it is not a quasi-corporation: it does not have a complete set of accounts, including balance sheets)- It is a market enterprise (it sells at least some of the goods or services it produces);- The enterprise is not registered or the employees of the enterprise are not registered or the number of persons engaged on a continuous basis is below a threshold determined by the country"
101,Indicator8-4-1,"Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP","Definitions:Material Footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material extraction to domestic final demand of a country. The total material footprint is the sum of the material footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic minerals. Concepts:Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) and MF need to be looked at in combination, as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final demand. A country can, for instance, have a very high DMC because it has a large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena. "
102,Indicator8-4-2,"Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP","Definitions:Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a national economy. DMC measures the total amount of material (biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic minerals) directly used in an economy and based on accounts of direct material flows, i.e., domestic material extraction and physical imports and exports.Concepts:DMC and Material Footprint (MF) need to be looked at in combination, as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final demand. A country can, for instance, have a very high DMC because it has a large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena. "
103,Indicator8-5-1,"Average hourly earnings of employees, by sex, age, occupation and persons with disabilities","Definition: This indicator provides information on the mean hourly earnings from paid employment of employees by sex, occupation, age, and disability status.   Concepts: Earnings refer to the gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid leave or holidays. Earnings exclude employers’ contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay.   For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to employees’ gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. As stated in the indicator title, data on earnings should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees. "
104,Indicator8-5-2,"Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","Definition: The unemployment rate conveys the percentage of persons in the labour force who are unemployed.  Concepts: Unemployed persons are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15 and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity, where: (a) “not in employment” is assessed with respect to the short reference period for the measurement of employment; (b) to “seek employment” refers to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period comprising the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a job or setting up a business or agricultural  undertaking; (c) the point when the enterprise starts to exist should be used to distinguish between search activities aimed at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as evidenced by the enterprise’s registration to operate or by when financial resources become available, the necessary infrastructure or materials are in place or the first client or order is received, depending on the context; (d) “currently available” serves as a test of readiness to start a job in the present, assessed with respect to a short reference period comprising that used to measure employment (depending on national circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a short subsequent period not exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure adequate coverage of unemployment situations among different population groups).   Persons in employment are defined as all those of working age (usually aged 15 and above) who, during a short reference period such as one week or one day, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The difference between the 13th and 19th ICLS series for a given country is the operational criteria used to define employment, with two series based on the statistical standards from the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) and the other two series based on 19th ICLS standards. In the 19th ICLS series, employment is defined more narrowly as work done for pay or profit, while activities not done mainly in exchange for remuneration (i.e., own-use production work, volunteer work and unpaid trainee work) are recognized as other forms of work. The labour force corresponds to the sum of persons in employment and in unemployment.  For more information on the definitions of employment and unemployment refer to the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization Adopted by the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians.  "
105,Indicator8-6-1,"Proportion of youth (aged 15–24 years) not in education, employment or training","Definition: This indicator conveys the proportion of youth (aged 15-24 years) not in education, employment or training (also known as ""the youth NEET rate""). Concepts: For the purposes of this indicator, youth is defined as all persons between the ages of 15 and 24 (inclusive). According to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), education is defined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system of a country. Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops, or seminars. Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, in the workplace, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially directed basis. For the purposes of this indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in formal or non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal learning. Employment is defined as all persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The difference between the two series for a given country is the operational criteria used to define employment, with one series based on the statistical standards from the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) and the other series based on 19th ICLS standards. In the 19th ICLS series, employment is defined more narrowly as work done for pay or profit, while activities not done mainly in exchange for remuneration (i.e., own-use production work, volunteer work and unpaid trainee work) are recognized as other forms of work. For the purpose of this indicator, persons are considered to be in training if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white collar related to a specific trade, occupation, or vocation. Technical training on the other hand imparts learning that can be applied in intermediate-level jobs, in particular those of technicians and middle managers.  "
106,Indicator8-7-1,"Proportion and number of children aged 5–17 years engaged in child labour, by sex and age","Definition:The number of children engaged in child labour corresponds to the number of children reported to be in child labour during the reference period (usually the week prior to the survey). The proportion of children in child labour is calculated as the number of children in child labour divided by the total number of children in the population.  For the purposes of this indicator, children include all persons aged 5 to 17.   Concepts:Three principal international legal instruments – ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) (C138), United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) (C182) together set the legal boundaries for child labour, and provide the legal basis for national and international actions against it.  In accordance with these instruments, child labour is work that children should not be doing because (a) they are too young or (b) is likely to harm their health, safety or morals, due to its nature or the conditions in which it is carried out. The resolutions adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS), the world’s acknowledged standard-setting body in the area of labour statistics, provide the basis for translating the legal standards governing the concept of child labour into statistical terms for the purpose of child labour measurement.   In accordance with the ICLS resolutions, child labour can be measured on the basis of the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (UN SNA) or on the basis of the general production boundary. The former limits the frame of reference to economic activity, while the latter extends it to include both economic activity and unpaid household services, that is, the production of domestic and personal services by a household member for consumption within their own household, commonly called “household chores”.   Following from this, two indicators are used for measuring child labour for the purpose of SDG reporting, the first based on the production boundary set by the UN SNA and the second based on the general production boundary. Indicator 1: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in economic activities at or above age-specific hourly thresholds (SNA production boundary basis)Child labour for the 5 to 11 age range: children working for 1 hour or more per week in economic activity; Child labour for the 12 to 14 age range: children working for 14 hours or more per week in economic activity;Child labour for the 15 to 17 age range: children working for 43 hours or more per week in economic activity. Indicator 2: Proportion and number of children aged 5-17 years engaged in economic activities and household chores at or above age-specific hourly thresholds (general production boundary basis): Child labour for the 5 to 11 age range: children working for 1 hour or more per week in economic activity and/or involved in unpaid household services for 21 hours or more per week; Child labour for the 12 to 14 age range: children working for 14 hours or more per week in economic activity and/or involved in unpaid household services for 21 hours or more per week; Child labour for the 15 to 17 age range: children working for 43 hours or more per week in economic activity.  The concept of child labour also includes the worst forms of child labour other than hazardous (18th ICLS paragraphs 33 to 34) as well as hazardous work (18th ICLS paragraphs 21 to 32). The worst forms of child labour include all forms of slavery or similar practices such as trafficking and the recruitment and use of child soldiers, the use or procurement of children for prostitution or other illicit activities, and other work that is likely to harm children’s health, safety or well-being.   "
107,Indicator8-8-1,"Fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 workers, by sex and migrant status","Definition: This indicator provides information on the number of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 workers in the reference group during the reference period. It is a measure of the personal likelihood or risk of having a fatal or a non-fatal occupational injury for each worker in the reference group.  The number of occupational injuries expressed per a given number of workers in the reference group is also known as the incidence rate of occupational injuries.  Concepts: Definitions of the main concepts presented below are derived from the Resolution concerning statistics of occupational injuries (resulting from occupational accidents), adopted by the 16th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) in 1998 (https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_087528/lang--en/index.htm).  Occupational accident: an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or death. Occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic accidents in which workers are injured and which arise out of or in the course of work; that is, while engaged in an economic activity, or at work, or carrying out the business of the employer.  Occupational injury: any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident. An occupational injury is different from an occupational disease, which comes as a result of an exposure over a period of time to risk factors linked to the work activity. Diseases are included only in cases where the disease arose as a direct result of an accident. An occupational injury can be fatal or non-fatal (and non-fatal injuries could entail the loss of workdays).  Fatal occupational injury: an occupational injury leading to death within one year of the day of the occupational accident.  Case of occupational injury: the case of one worker incurring one or more occupational injuries as a result of one occupational accident.   Workers in the reference group: workers in the reference group refer to the average number of workers in the particular group under consideration and who are covered by the source of the statistics on occupational injuries (for example, those of a specific sex or in a specific economic activity, occupation, region, age group, or any combination of these, or those covered by a particular insurance scheme, accident notification systems, or household or establishment survey). "
108,Indicator8-8-2,"Level of national compliance with labour rights (freedom of association and collective bargaining) based on International Labour Organization (ILO) textual sources and national legislation, by sex and migrant status","Definition:The indicator measures the level of national compliance with fundamental rights at work (freedom of association and collective bargaining, FACB) for all ILO member states based on six international ILO supervisory body textual sources and also on national legislation. It is based on the coding of textual sources against a list of evaluation criteria and then converting the coding into indicators. Concepts:Freedom of association and collective bargaining rights and their supervisionThe principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining (FACB) are and have long been at the core of the ILO’s normative foundations. These foundations have been established in the ILO’s Constitution (1919), the ILO Declaration of Philadelphia (1944), in two key ILO Conventions (namely the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98)) and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (1998). They are also rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and other international and regional human rights instruments. With the adoption of the 1998 ILO Declaration, the promotion and realization of these fundamental principles and rights also became a constitutional obligation of all ILO member States.FACB rights are considered as ‘enabling rights’, the realisation of which is necessary to promote and realise other rights at work. They provide an essential foundation for social dialogue, effective labour market governance and realization of decent work. They are vital in enabling employers and workers to associate and efficiently negotiate work relations, to ensure that both employers and workers have an equal voice in negotiations, and that the outcome is fair and equitable. As such they play a crucial role in the elaboration of economic and social policies that take on board the interests and needs of all actors in the economy. FACB rights are also salient because they are indispensable pillars of democracy as well as the process of democratization.FACB rights, together with other international labour standards, are backed by the ILO’s unique supervisory system. The ILO regularly examines the application of standards in member States and highlights areas where those standards are violated and where they could be better applied. The ILO’s supervisory system includes two kinds of supervisory mechanisms: the regular system of supervision and the special procedures. The prior entails the examination of periodic reports submitted by member States on the measures taken to implement the provisions of ILO Conventions ratified by them. The special procedures, that is, representations, complaints and the special procedure for complaints regarding freedom of association through the Freedom of Association Committee, allow for the examination of violations on the basis of a submission of a representation or a complaint. "
109,Indicator8-9-1,Tourism direct GDP as a proportion of total GDP and in growth rate,"Definition: Tourism Direct GDP (TDGDP) is defined as the sum of the part of gross value added (at basic prices) generated by all industries in response to internal tourism consumption plus the amount of net taxes on products and imports included within the value of this expenditure at purchasers’ prices. The indicator relies on the Tourism Satellite Account: Recommended Methodological Framework 2008, an international standard adopted by the UN Statistical Commission and led by UNWTO, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and EUROSTAT.   Concepts: Tourism direct gross value added (TDGVA) is the part of gross value added generated by tourism industries and other industries of the economy that directly serve visitors in response to internal tourism consumption.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP): It is the main measure of national output, representing the total value of all final goods and services within the System of National Accounts (SNA) production boundary produced in a particular economy (that is, the dollar value of all goods and services within the SNA production boundary produced within a country’s borders in a given year). According to the SNA, “GDP is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of output. GDP is also equal to the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers’ prices, less the value of imports of goods and services. GDP is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units.” "
110,Indicator8-10-1,"(a) Number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults and (b) number of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults","Definition: The number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults The number of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults Adult population refers to the total population in the reporting jurisdiction of individuals 15 years old and above Concepts: The number of commercial bank branches refers to the total number of commercial bank branches in the country reported annually by the central bank or the main financial regulator of the country to the Financial Access Survey (FAS).  To make the indicator meaningful for cross-country comparison, the number of commercial bank branches is scaled per 100,000 adults. The number of automated teller machines (ATMs), refers to the number of ATMs in the country for all types of financial institutions such as: commercial banks, non-deposit taking microfinance institutions, deposit taking micro finance institutions, credit unions and credit cooperatives, and other deposit takers. This information is reported annually by the central bank or the main financial regulator of the country to the FAS.  To make the indicator meaningful for cross-country comparison, the number of ATMs is scaled per 100,000 adults.  "
111,Indicator8-10-2,Proportion of adults (15 years and older) with an account at a bank or other financial institution or with a mobile-money-service provider,"Definition: The percentage of adults (ages 15+) who report having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank or another type of financial institution or personally using a mobile money service in the past 12 months.   Concepts: Financial institution accounts (excluding mobile money) denote the percentage of respondents who report having an account (by themselves or together with someone else) at a bank, credit union, microfinance institution, or post office that falls under prudential regulation by a government body.Data on adults with a financial institution account include respondents who reported having an account at a bank or at another type of financial institution, such as a credit union, a microfinance institution, a cooperative, or the post office (if applicable). The data also include an additional 3 percent of respondents in 2021 who reported receiving wages, government transfers, a public sector pension, or payments for agricultural products into a financial institution account in the past year; paying utility bills or school fees from a financial institution account in the past year; or receiving wages, government transfers, or agricultural payments into a card in the past year. The definition does not include non-bank financial institutions such as pension funds, retirement accounts, insurance companies, or equity holdings such as stocks. Mobile money accounts denote the percentage of respondents who report personally using a mobile money service to make payments, buy things, or to send or receive money in the past year. Data on adults with a mobile money account include respondents who reported personally using services included in the GSM Association’s Mobile Money for the Unbanked (GSMA MMU) database to pay bills or to send or receive money in the past year. The data also include an additional 2 percent of respondents in 2021 who reported receiving wages, government transfers, a public sector pension, or payments for agricultural products through a mobile phone in the past year. Unlike the definition of account at a financial institution, the definition of mobile money account does not include the payment of utility bills or school fees through a mobile phone. The reason is that the phrasing of the possible answers leaves it open as to whether those payments were made using a mobile money account or an over-the-counter service."
112,Indicator8-a-1,Aid for Trade commitments and disbursements,"Definition:   This indicator is defined as gross disbursements and commitments of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all donors for aid for trade. Concepts: The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines Official Development Assistance (ODA) as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) concessional (i.e. grants and soft loans) and administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective.For more details see here: https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm All donors refer to DAC donors, other bilateral providers of development cooperation and multilateral organizations.  Aid for Trade is captured in the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) under four categories:Economic infrastructure: Amounts relating to trade-related infrastructure are provided in the CRS by data under the sector code heading “Economic Infrastructure and Services” and cover the sectors transport and storage, communications and energy generation and supply.Trade policy and regulations: In the CRS, five sector codes (in the 331xx series) are used to capture trade policy and regulations activities: trade policy and administrative management; trade facilitation; regional trade agreements; multilateral trade negotiations; and trade education/training.Trade-related adjustment: this sector code (33150) was introduced in the CRS as a separate data item in 2007 to track flows corresponding to trade-related adjustment. This category identifies contributions to developing country budgets to assist the implementation of trade reforms and adjustments to trade policy measures by other countries and alleviate shortfalls in balance-of-payments due to changes in the world trading environment.Building Productive capacity (BPC), including trade development: The CRS captures full data on all activities in the productive and services sectors, such as agriculture; industry; mineral resources and mining; business; and banking. See for reference: http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/dacandcrscodelists.htm "
113,Indicator8-b-1,"Existence of a developed and operationalized national strategy for youth employment, as a distinct strategy or as part of a national employment strategy","The proposed methodology draws on:Global policy instruments, notably:Resolution on The youth employment crisis: A call for action, adopted at the 101st session of the International Labour Conference (ILC) in June 2012. In calling for vigorous, collective action to address an aggravated youth employment crisis, this resolution advocates for a multi-pronged approach with policy measures that are context-specific and integrated, entailing strategies which bring together in a coherent manner a variety of instruments to increase the demand, enhance the supply and improve matching in youth labour markets.Recovering from the crisis: A Global Jobs Pact adopted by the ILC at its June 2009 session. Based on the ILO’s Decent Work Agenda, the Global Jobs Pact presents an integrated portfolio of policies that puts employment and social protection at the centre of crisis response, recognising the critical role of participation and social dialogue.   ILO databases:International monitoring of youth employment policies was carried out over the period 2010-2012 by the Youth Employment Network (YEN) – a partnership between the ILO, United Nations and World Bank – utilising a questionnaire sent to national authorities. This evolved into YouthPOL, an inventory of youth employment policies and programmes maintained by the ILO (65 countries covered to date). The ILO also maintains EmPol, a dataset of broader national employment policies (143 countries covered)."
114,Indicator9-1-1,Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road,"Definitions:The indicator (commonly known as the Rural Access Index or RAI) measures the share of a country’s rural population that lives within 2 km of an all-season road.Concepts:The indicator is measured by combining three sets of geospatial data: where people live, the spatial distribution of the road network, and road passability. The use of spatial data has various advantages. It can help ensure consistency across countries. The level of spatial resolution is broadly the same regardless of the size of the country or subnational boundaries. Any given norm of connectivity (for example, 2 km distance from a road) is uniquely and unambiguously applied for all countries. Population Distribution - Quality population distribution data are essential for correct measurement of rural access. In some countries, census data is available in a geospatially detailed, reliable format. For other countries, population distribution data sets have been developed by the international research community, interpreting subnational census data through various modelling techniques. For the RAI, WorldPop data has been found to provide a reliable estimate. That estimate can also be refined through engagement between the national statistics offices and WorldPop to reconcile data at the level of enumeration areas.Rural-Urban Definition – Related to population distribution data, an important challenge facing the index is the need for a consistent and reliable urban and rural definition to exclude urban areas from the calculation. The inclusion of urban areas would create a substantial upward bias in the RAI, because most urban residents have “access to roads,” no matter how it is defined. Ideally, spatial data determining urban-rural boundaries are needed at a similar level of resolution as the population. As such data may rely on different definitions in different countries, globally produced urban extents may be used, such as the Global Urban Rural Mapping Project v1 Urban Extent Polygons.Road Network Data – Data on road locations may come from a number of sources. Ideally government data are used, as they are consistent with the road network for which road agencies are responsible and are relatively easily merged with other operational databases. In countries where the road location data may not be detailed enough or entirely missing or where there is a large unclassified network, alternative data sources may be available, such as the open source OpenStreetMap. Road Condition Data – The principle of the “all-season” road network remains central to the original concept of measuring the RAI.  An “all-season road” is defined as a road that is motorable all year round by the prevailing means of rural transport (often a pick-up or a truck which does not have four-wheel-drive). Predictable interruptions of short duration during inclement weather (e.g. heavy rainfall) are accepted, particularly on low volume roads. A road that it is likely to be impassable to the prevailing means of rural transport for a total of 7 days or more per year is not regarded as all-season. Note that some roads agencies use the term “all-weather” to describe their roads, however “all-weather” typically means “paved” and should not be confused with “all-season” which can include unpaved roads too.It is important to determine whether access to facilities and services is available all year round, and hence the possibility of the road throughout the year is an essential factor in this aspect of contributing to poverty reduction. Information on the condition of the road network is frequently maintained by road agencies as part of their operational responsibilities. The traditional road inventory survey can collect data on road condition, including the International Roughness Index (IRI), at a high level of information quality, to determine whether a road is “all-season”. For the purpose of the RAI, the road condition threshold is generally set at an IRI of less than 6 meters/km for paved roads, and an IRI of less than 13 meters/km for unpaved roads. When IRI is not available, other types of condition assessment may be used if comparable.  The use of smartphones with GPS are being investigated in order to accurately map local transport services routes, and identify which rural roads are open all year and hence are all-season roads. These condition thresholds should only be used, however, where there is reliable road condition data available. The parameters should be calibrated to the local conditions, i.e. checks should be made to determine that paved roads in poor condition are largely not all-season, and that unpaved roads in fair or poor condition are largely not all-season. The parameters can be adjusted accordingly to the local conditions, based on a systematic and documented study.In the event that accurate road condition data is not available, then accessibility factors provide an alternative means to road condition for identifying “all-season” roads. Such factors do not require ground measurements of road condition to be made. Accessibility factors are those which determine the likelihood of a road being all-season, or the risk of a road being inaccessible."
115,Indicator9-1-2,"Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport","Definitions:Passenger volumes are measured in passenger-kilometres while freight volumes are measured in tonne-kilometres, and broken down by mode of transport. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, passenger-km data are split between aviation, road (broken down between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles) and rail, and tonne-km are split between aviation, road, rail and inland waterways. Maritime freight is measured in metric tons and container port traffic is measured in twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU).Concepts:Aviation:The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its Statistics Division has established standard methodologies and definitions to collect and report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to air transport. These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the 193 Member States of ICAO and also by the Industry stakeholders i.e. air carriers and airports. The data of ICAO is used by States and also the World Bank for its development indicators. ICAO uses Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport. The aviation data reported under indicator 9.1.2 is for scheduled traffic.Precise definition of all different concepts and metadata related to Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport, as approved by the ICAO Statistics Division and Member States can be found at the ICAO website given below -http://www.icao.int/sustainability/pages/eap-sta-excel.aspx/.MartimeDefinitions:International maritime freight is an indicator reflecting (1) the sum of international freight volumes loaded (exports) and unloaded (imports) at ports worldwide and measured in metric tonnes, and (2) container port traffic at world ports measured in twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU).Data is collected by the UNCTAD secretariat from various sources, including industry, government and specialised maritime transport data providers and consultancies. Volumes are expressed in metric tonnes and twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU).As data on international maritime freight volumes are not widely available, only the data in tonnes (rather than tonne-km) and at the regional level are reported.Data at country level are available for container port traffic measured in twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU).Concepts:The UNCTAD secretariat collects and compiles the data from various websites and reports, including, by port and industry associations and authorities, national statistics offices, UN Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, governments, specialised agencies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and British Petroleum (BP). Data is also collected from reports issued by maritime specialised sources such as Drewry Maritime Research (DMR), Clarksons Research Services (CRS), Dynamar, and Lloyd’s List Intelligence (LLI).Road, Rail, Inland waterwaysFor definitions of all relevant terms, the UNECE/ITF/Eurostat Glossary for Transport Statistics can be consulted.

116,Indicator9-2-1,Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and per capita,"Definitions:Manufacturing value added (MVA) as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) is a ratio between MVA and GDP, both reported in constant 2015 USD.MVA per capita is calculated by dividing MVA in constant 2015 USD by population of a country or area.Concepts:The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the units’ total output less intermediate consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the section C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries MVA and GDP are estimated in terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2015."
117,Indicator9-2-2,Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment,"Definitions:This indicator presents the share of manufacturing employment in total employment.Concepts:Employment comprises all persons of working age who during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The difference between the two series for a given country is the operational criteria used to define employment, with one series based on the statistical standards from the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) and the other series based on 19th ICLS standards. In the 19th ICLS series, employment is defined more narrowly as work done for pay or profit, while activities not done mainly in exchange for remuneration (i.e., own-use production work, volunteer work and unpaid trainee work) are recognized as other forms of work. No distinction is made between persons employed full time and those working less than full time.The manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) revision 4 (2008, the latest) or revision 3 (1990). It refers to industries belonging to sector C in revision 4 or sector D in revision 3."
118,Indicator9-3-1,Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added,"Definitions:Small-scale industrial enterprises, in the SDG framework also called “small-scale industries”, defined here for the purpose of statistical data collection and compilation refer to statistical units, generally enterprises, engaged in production of goods and services for market below a designated size class.Proportion of “small-scale industries” in total industry value added represents an indicator calculating the share of manufacturing value added of small-scale manufacturing enterprises in the total manufacturing value added.Concepts:International recommendations for industrial statistics 2008 (IRIS 2008) (United Nations, 2011) define an enterprise as the smallest legal unit that constitutes an organizational unit producing goods or services. The enterprise is the basic statistical unit at which all information relating to its production activities and transactions, including financial and balance-sheet accounts, are maintained. It is also used for institutional sector classification in the 2008 System of National Accounts.An establishment is defined as an enterprise or part of an enterprise that is situated in a single location and in which only a single productive activity is carried out or in which the principal productive activity accounts for most of the value added. An establishment can be defined ideally as an economic unit that engages, under single ownership or control, that is, under a single legal entity, in one, or predominantly one, kind of economic activity at a single physical location. Mines, factories and workshops are examples. This ideal concept of an establishment is applicable to many of the situations encountered in industrial inquiries, particularly in manufacturing.Although the definition of an establishment allows for the possibility that there may be one or more secondary activities carried out in it, their magnitude should be small compared with that of the principal activity. If a secondary activity within an establishment is as important, or nearly as important, as the principal activity, then the unit is more like a local unit. It should be subdivided so that the secondary activity is treated as taking place within an establishment separate from the establishment in which the principal activity takes place.In the case of most small-sized businesses, the enterprise and the establishment will be identical. Some enterprises are large and complex with different kinds of economic activities undertaken at different locations. Such enterprises should be broken down into one or more establishments, provided that smaller and more homogeneous production units can be identified for which production data may be meaningfully compiled. As introduced in IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011), an economic activity is understood as referring to a process, that is, the combination of actions carried out by a certain entity that uses labor, capital, goods and services to produce specific products (goods and services). In general, industrial statistics reflect the characteristics and economic activities of units engaged in a class of industrial activities that are defined in terms of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 4 (ISIC Rev.4) (United Nations, 2008) or International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 3.1 (ISIC Rev. 3) (United Nations, 2002).Total numbers of persons employed is defined as the total number of persons who work in or for the statistical unit, whether full-time or part-time, including:Working proprietorsActive business partnersUnpaid family workersPaid employees (for more details see United Nations, 2011).The size of a statistical unit based on employment should be defined primarily in terms of the average number of persons employed in that unit during the reference period. If the average number of persons employed is not available, the total number of persons employed in a single period may be used as the size criterion. The size classification should consist of the following classes of the average number of persons employed: 1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-249, 250 and more. This should be considered a minimum division of the overall range; more detailed classifications, where required, should be developed within this framework.Value added cannot be directly observed from the accounting records of the units. It is derived as the difference between gross output or census output and intermediate consumption or census input (United Nations, 2011). The value added at basic prices is calculated as the difference between the gross output at basic prices and the intermediate consumption at purchasers’ prices. The valuation of value added closely corresponds to the valuation of gross output. If the output is valued at basic prices, then the valuation of value added is also at basic prices (the valuation of intermediate consumption is always at purchasers’ prices).All above mentioned terms are introduced to be in line with IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011)."
119,Indicator9-3-2,Proportion of small-scale industries with a loan or line of credit,"Definitions:Small-scale industrial enterprises, in the SDG framework also called “small-scale industries”, defined here for the purpose of statistical data collection and compilation refer to statistical units, generally enterprises, engaged in production of goods and services for market below a designated size class.This indicator shows the number of “small-scale industries” with an active line of credit or a loan from a financial institution in the reference year in percentage to the total number of such enterprises.Concepts:International recommendations for industrial statistics 2008 (IRIS 2008) (United Nations, 2011) define an enterprise as the smallest legal unit that constitutes an organizational unit producing goods or services.

This should be considered a minimum division of the overall range; more detailed classifications, where required, should be developed within this framework.A loan is a financial instrument that is created when a creditor lends funds directly to a debtor and receives a non-negotiable document as evidence of the asset. This category includes overdrafts, mortgage loans, loans to finance trade credit and advances, repurchase agreements, financial assets and liabilities created by financial leases, and claims on or liabilities to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the form of loans. Trade credit and advances and similar accounts payable/receivable are not loans. Loans that have become marketable in secondary markets should be reclassified under debt securities. However, if only traded occasionally, the loan is not reclassified under debt securities (IMF, 2011).Lines of credit and loan commitments provide a guarantee that undrawn funds will be available in the future, but no financial liability/asset exists until such funds are provided. Undrawn lines of credit and undisbursed loan commitments are contingent liabilities of the issuing institutions— generally, banks (IMF, 2011). A loan or line of credit refers to regulated financial institutions only."
120,Indicator9-4-1,CO2 emission per unit of value added,"Definitions:Carbon dioxide (here after, CO2) emissions per unit of value added is an indicator computed as ratio between CO2 emissions from fuel combustion and the value added of associated economic activities. The indicator can be computed for the whole economy (total CO2 emissions/GDP) or for specific sectors, notably the manufacturing sector (CO2 emissions from manufacturing industries per manufacturing value added (MVA)). Concepts:Total CO2 emissions for an economy are estimated based on energy consumption data for all sectors.CO2 emissions from manufacturing are based on energy data collected across the following subsectors (energy used for transport by industry is not included here but reported under transport):Iron and steel industry [ISIC Group 241 and Class 2431];Chemical and petrochemical industry [ISIC Divisions 20 and 21] excluding petrochemical feedstocks;Non-ferrous metals basic industries [ISIC Group 242 and Class 2432];Non-metallic minerals such as glass, ceramic, cement, etc. [ISIC Division 23];Transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 29 and 30];Machinery comprises fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment other than transport equipment [ISIC Divisions 25 to 28];Food and tobacco [ISIC Divisions 10 to 12];Paper, pulp and printing [ISIC Divisions 17 and 18];Wood and wood products (other than pulp and paper) [ISIC Division 16];Textile and leather [ISIC Divisions 13 to 15];Non-specified (any manufacturing industry not included above) [ISIC Divisions 22, 31 and 32].Energy data are collected at a country level, based on internationally agreed standards (UN International Recommendations on Energy Statistics (IRES)). CO2 emissions need to be estimated based on energy data and on internationally agreed methodologies (2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories). The IEA collects national energy data, according to internationally agreed energy statistics definitions and estimates CO2 emissions based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories’ Tier 1 methodology, producing internationally comparable CO2 emissions data for over 150 countries and regions.The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector in a country. The gross value added generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the units’ total output less intermediate consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries, GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP) is used to calculate the total CO2 emissions intensity of the economy. MVA is estimated in terms of constant prices in USD. The current series are given at constant prices of 2015."
121,Indicator9-5-1,Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP,"Definitions:Research and experimental development (R&D) expenditure as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the amount of Research and experimental development (R&D) expenditure divided by the total output of the economy.Concepts:The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development (R&D), gross domestic expenditure on research and experimental development (R&D) and researchers. Although an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) manual, the application is global. During the 6th revision of the Frascati Manual, developing country issues were mainstreamed in the core of the Manual. The 7th edition was released in October 2015.The following definitions, taken from the 2015 edition of the Frascati Manual are relevant for computing the indicator. Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge – including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and to devise new applications of available knowledge.Expenditures on intramural research and experimental development (R&D) represent the amount of money spent on research and experimental development (R&D) that is performed within a reporting unit."
122,Indicator9-5-2,Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants,"Definitions:The researchers (in full-time equivalent - FTE) per million inhabitants is a direct measure of the number of research and experimental development (R&D) workers per 1 million people.Concepts:The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015) provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development (R&D), gross domestic expenditure on research and experimental development (R&D) and researchers.

Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge – including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and to devise new applications of available knowledge.Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge. They conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques instrumentation, software or operational methods.The Full-time equivalent (FTE) of research and experimental development (R&D) personnel is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on research and experimental development (R&D) during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group."
123,Indicator9-a-1,Total official international support (official development assistance plus other official flows) to infrastructure,"Definitions:Gross disbursements of total ODA and other official flows from all donors in support of infrastructure.Concepts:ODA: The DAC defines ODA as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and each transaction   is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; andis concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional.(See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf,  Para 24).Support to infrastructure includes all CRS sector codes in the 200 series (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm)"
124,Indicator9-b-1,Proportion of medium and high-tech industry value added in total value added,"Definitions:The proportion of medium-high and high-tech industry (MHT hereafter) value added in total value added of manufacturing (MVA hereafter) is a ratio value between the value added of MHT industry and MVA.Concepts:The value added of an industry (industry value added) is a survey concept that refers to the given industry’s net output derived from the difference of gross output and intermediate consumption. Manufacturing sector is defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 3 (1990) or Revision 4 (2008). It refers to industries belonging to Section D in ISIC Revision 3 or Section C in ISIC Revision 4.Technology classification is based on research and development (R&D) expenditure relative to value added (R&D intensity hereafter).  Data for R&D intensity are presented in a report published by the OECD (OECD, 2003; Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016, for ISIC Revision 3 and 4 respectively), which also proposes a taxonomy for industry groups with different ranges of R&D expenditure relative to their gross value added. MHT industries have traditionally been defined exclusively to manufacturing industries. However, there have been recent efforts (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016) to extend the definition to non-manufacturing industries as well. Nevertheless, medium-high and high technology sectors are primarily represented by manufacturing industries.The following table includes the classification of MHT industries by ISIC Rev. 3 and ISIC Rev. 4.* Excluding 301 (Building of ships and boats)** Excluding 351 (Building and repairing of ships and boats)MVA is the value added of manufacturing industry, which is Section C of ISIC Rev.4 or Section D of ISIC Rev.3.

125,Indicator9-c-1,"Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology","Definitions:Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, broken down by technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living within range of a mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are mobile phone subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population and multiplying by 100.Concepts:The indicator is based on where the population lives, and not where they work or go to school, etc. When there are multiple operators offering the service, the maximum population number covered should be reported. Coverage should refer to LTE and above (4G), broadband (3G) and any technology (2G) mobile-cellular technologies and include:- 2G mobile population coverage: refers to the percentage of inhabitants that are within range of at least a 2G mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. This includes mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS, CDMA2000 1x and most EDGE implementations. The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of subscribers to use non-broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active users of such services. - 3G population coverage: refers to the percentage of inhabitants that are within range of at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants that are covered by at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal by the total population and multiplying by 100. It excludes people covered only by GPRS, EDGE or CDMA 1xRTT.- LTE population coverage: Refers to the percentage of inhabitants that live within range of LTE/LTE-Advanced, mobile WiMAX/WirelessMAN or other more advanced mobile-cellular networks, irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants that are covered by the previously mentioned mobile-cellular technologies by the total population and multiplying by 100. It excludes people covered only by HSPA, UMTS, EV-DO and previous 3G technologies, and also excludes fixed WiMAX coverage.As technologies evolve and as more and more countries will deploy and commercialize more advanced mobile-broadband networks (5G etc.), the indicator will include further breakdowns."
126,Indicator10-1-1,Growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita among the bottom 40 per cent of the population and the total population,"Definition:The growth rate in the welfare aggregate of bottom 40% is computed as the annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of the bottom 40% of the income distribution in a country from household surveys over a roughly 5-year period.The national average growth rate in the welfare aggregate is computed as the annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of the total population in a country from household surveys over a roughly 5-year period.Concepts:Promoting shared prosperity is defined as fostering income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution in every country and is measured by calculating the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent. The choice of the bottom 40 percent as the target population is one of practical compromise. The bottom 40 percent differs across countries depending on the welfare distribution, and it can change over time within a country. Because boosting shared prosperity is a country-specific goal, there is no numerical target defined globally."
127,Indicator10-2-1,"Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","Definition:The proportion of people living below 50 percent of median income (or consumption) is the share (%) of a country’s population living on less than half of the consumption/income level of the median of the national income/consumption distribution. Concepts:The indicator is measured using per capita welfare measure of consumption or income. The indicator is calculated by estimating the share of the population in a country living on less than 50% of median of the national distribution of income or consumption, as estimated from survey data. Consumption distributions typically capture household expenditure on a set of items over a given period of time. These usually include purchased, own-produced, exchanged, and gifted food and non-food items (for example clothing, housing—including imputed rent—and the use value of durable consumer goods). Income distributions capture the value of monetary inflow a household receives or earns over a given period of time. Household surveys usually provide information on labor income (salaries, own-business, and self-employment income), as well as non-labor income coming from pensions, subsidies, transfers, property income, scholarships, etc. Income distributions used here aim to measure disposable income defined as the sum of labor and non-labor income (including transfers) less taxes and contributions. The exact definition and operationalization of income aggregates varies across different data sources. Per capita income or consumption is estimated using total household income or consumption divided by the total household size. The estimation relies on the same harmonized welfare vectors (distributions) that are used for 10.1.1 and 1.1.1. Using the same data and closely related methodologies ensures internal consistency across these closely related indicators. The data is available through the Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP), the World Bank’s online tool for reporting global poverty and inequality numbers. For details on concepts and standards, refer to documentation available on the PIP website.The methodology entails measuring the share of people living below 50% of national median. A threshold set at 50% of the median of the income or consumption is used to derive a headcount rate, similar to how monetary poverty is typically measured. The national median is readily available from the distributional data in PIP. The measurement follows a two-step process of first estimating half of the national median income (or consumption) and then the share of people living below this relative threshold.The indicator uses the same data on household income and consumption that is used for monitoring SDG indicators 1.1.1 and 10.1.1, which have been classified as Tier 1 indicators. The methodology and data are similar to that used in measuring international poverty, which has been tested and vetted over many years, including for the purpose of monitoring Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 1. It is also closely related to a large literature of relative poverty measurement."
128,Indicator10-3-1,Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law,"Definition:This indicator is defined as the proportion of the population (adults) who self-report that they personally experienced discrimination or harassment during the last 12 months based on ground(s) prohibited by international human rights law. International human rights law refers to the body of international legal instruments aiming to promote and protect human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent international human rights treaties adopted by the United Nations.Concepts:Discrimination is any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that is directly or indirectly based on prohibited grounds of discrimination, and which has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.  Harassment is a form of discrimination when it is also based on prohibited grounds of discrimination. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions, which tend to annoy, alarm, abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another or which create an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. While generally involving a pattern of behaviours, harassment can take the form of a single incident.International human rights law provides lists of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. The inclusion of “other status” in these lists indicate that they are not exhaustive and that other grounds may be recognized by international human rights mechanisms. A review of the international human rights normative framework helps identify a list of grounds that includes race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national origin, social origin, property, birth status, disability, age, nationality, marital and family status, sexual orientation, gender identity, health status, place of residence, economic and social situation, pregnancy, indigenous status, afro-descent and other status. In practice, it will be difficult to include all potentially relevant grounds of discrimination in household survey questions. For this reason, it is recommended that data collectors identify contextually relevant and feasible lists of grounds, drawing on the illustrative list and formulation of prohibited grounds of discrimination outlined in the methodology section below, and add an “other” category to reflect other grounds that may not have been listed explicitly."
129,Indicator10-4-1,Labour share of GDP,"Definition:Labour share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total compensation of employees and the labour income of the self-employed given as a percent of GDP, which is a measure of total output. It provides information about the relative share of output which accrues to workers as compared with the share that accrues to capital in the production process for a given reference period.Concepts:Compensation of employees is the total in-cash or in-kind remuneration payable to the employee by the enterprise for the work performed by the employee during the accounting period. Compensation of employees includes: (i) wages and salaries (in cash or in kind) and (ii) social insurance contributions payable by employers. This concept views compensation of employees as a cost to employer, thus compensation equals zero for unpaid work undertaken voluntarily. Moreover, it does not include taxes payable by employers on the wage and salary bill, such as payroll tax.The indicator should be produced using data that cover all economic activities, all employees, and the self-employed. Thus, in addition to the compensation of employees, the indicator should also include the labour income of the self-employed.GDP represents the market value of all final goods and services produced during a specific time period (for the purposes of this indicator, one year) in a country's territory.Persons in employment are defined as all those persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. For the sake of clarity, the term “workers” is used as shorthand for “persons in employment”.Persons in employment include employees and self-employed.Employees are all those workers who hold the type of job defined as paid employment jobs, that is, jobs where the incumbents hold explicit or implicit employment contracts giving them a basic remuneration not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit for which they work. The self-employed are workers in jobs where the remuneration is directly dependent upon the profits (or the potential for profits) derived from the goods and services produced (where own consumption is considered to be part of profits). The incumbents make the operational decisions affecting the enterprise, or delegate such decisions while retaining responsibility for the welfare of the enterprise. (In this context “enterprise"" includes one-person operations.) The labour income of a self-employed worker is the implicit element of the remuneration for work done by themselves, as opposed to the element of remuneration generated by the ownership of assets. "
130,Indicator10-4-2,Redistributive impact of fiscal policy,"Definitions:The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator is defined as the Gini Index of pre-fiscal per capita (or equivalized) income less the Gini Index of post-fiscal per capita (or equivalized) income.  These terms are elaborated below and can be calculated with some different variations.Concepts:-Gini Index: a commonly used measure of inequality capturing the statistical dispersion in the distribution of income over a population (Gini, 1936).  A Gini Index of zero expresses perfect equality: that is, every individual in the population has the same income.  A Gini Index of 100 expresses maximum inequality: that is, all income accrues to a single individual, and all other individuals have zero income.Household income: this can be calculated: (i) in per capita terms (household income divided by the number of household members); or (ii) in equivalized terms (household income divided by the square root of the number of household members).  If a different definition is used, it should be noted in the reporting document.-Pre-fiscal income: the cumulative income accruing to an individual (or a household) from market and private sources only.  The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator can be estimated with reference to two different pre-fiscal income concepts depending on assumptions regarding the nature of the public, contributory old-age pension system (please also see the figure below, adapted from Lustig (2018) and in Lustig chapter 1, Section 2.2, pp. 20-29):  Pre-fiscal income 1 -  under the “pensions as deferred income” scenario: When incomes from public contributory old-age pension-system are counted as deferred market income and old-age pension-system contributions are counted as savings from current income (that is, the old-age pension system is treated as the equivalent of a mandatory savings program), pre-fiscal income is defined as an individual’s earned and unearned incomes from market and other private sources: wages, interest and dividend income; imputed income from owner-occupied housing and from consumption of own production; remittances; private transfers; old-age pension income from the public contributory pension system; and, less any contributions to the public old-age contributory pension system.  In this case, the pre-fiscal income concept is called Market income plus pensions.Pre-fiscal income 2 - under the “pensions as government transfer” scenario:  When incomes from current pension system are counted as a government transfer and old age pension system contributions are counted as a tax on current income, pre-fiscal income is defined as: wages, interest and dividend income; imputed income from owner-occupied housing and from consumption of own production; remittances; and private transfers only. In this case, the pre-fiscal income concept is called Market income.When pensions are treated as pure government transfers, the redistributive effect of pensions may be exaggerated as retirees with zero or near zero pre-fiscal incomes will receive pension income that is – at least in part – income deferred when the individual was working. It is important to note that deferral of own income from one’s working years to one’s retired self is possible regardless of whether the pension system is actuarially fair and in both defined-contribution and defined-benefit pension plans. Treating the public contributory pension system income as pure deferred income, however, does not allow us to capture any portion of the redistributive effect of pensions which may in effect exist. Therefore, we view the pensions as government transfer and pensions as deferred income scenarios as imperfect upper and lower bound estimates (respectively) of the true redistributive effect of contributory pensions. Rather than generating estimates of the redistributive effect of fiscal policy under specific assumptions about public contributory pension system income, the OECD instead reports estimates of the redistributive effect for the population under 65 years of age (while treating contributions to the public contributory pension system as a tax).  This is most comparable to the “pensions as deferred income” scenario, although not exactly the same. -Post-fiscal income: The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator can be estimated with reference to two different post-fiscal income concepts, Disposable Income and Consumable Income.  The most comprehensive concept is that of Consumable Income, which incorporates not only the impact of direct taxes and transfers but also of indirect taxes and price subsidies. Disposable and Consumable Income are equal in value under the “pensions as deferred income” and “pensions as government transfer” scenarios.  However, they are derived from pre-fiscal income 1 and pre-fiscal income 2 differently; please see the figure below, adapted from Lustig (2018):  Post-fiscal incomes under the “pensions as deferred income” scenario: Post-fiscal Income A - Disposable Income: pre-fiscal income less direct taxes paid and less social insurance contributions made to the public fiscal authority plus direct cash transfers and the monetary value of benefits (measured at what governments spend) received by households in the form of near-cash transfers (e.g., food stamps, school breakfasts, school uniforms). Post-fiscal Income B - Consumable Income: pre-fiscal income less direct and indirect taxes paid and less social insurance contributions other than for old-age pensions made to the public fiscal authority plus direct cash transfers and the monetary value of benefits (measured at what governments spend) received by households in the form of near-cash transfers (e.g., food stamps, school breakfasts, school and indirect price subsidies. Post-fiscal incomes under the “pensions as government transfer” scenario: Post-fiscal Income A - Disposable Income: pre-fiscal income less direct taxes paid and less social insurance contributions and less contributory old-age pension contributions made to the public fiscal authority plus direct cash transfers and the monetary value of benefits (measured at what governments spend) received by households in the form of near-cash transfers (e.g., food stamps, school breakfasts, school uniforms). Post-fiscal Income B - Consumable Income: pre-fiscal income less direct and indirect taxes paid and less social insurance contributions and less contributory old-age pension contributions made to the public fiscal authority plus direct cash transfers and the monetary value of benefits (measured at what governments spend) received by households in the form of near-cash transfers (e.g., food stamps, school breakfasts, school uniforms), and plus indirect price subsidies.

131,Indicator10-5-1,Financial Soundness Indicators,"Definition:Seven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent.1	- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets 2	- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 3	- Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital 4	- Nonperforming loans to total gross loans 5	- Return on assets 6	- Liquid assets to short-term liabilities 7	- Net open position in foreign exchange to capital Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) assets. For jurisdictions that have implemented the Basel III leverage ratio, this indicator would be calculated using Tier 1 capital as the numerator and the exposure measure as the denominator, which comprises balance sheet assets, derivatives exposures, securities financing transaction exposures, and off-balance-sheet items. Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets: It is calculated using regulatory Tier 1 capital as the numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in accordance with the implemented Basel Accord (i.e., Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III).  Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of nonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific provisions for NPLs as the numerator and total regulatory capital as the denominator.  Nonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the numerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific provisions for NPLs) as the denominator.  Return on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before taxes by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  Liquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using liquid assets as the numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator.The components of liquid assets are defined in the IMF’s  2019 FSIs Compilation Guide (2019 FSIs Guide).   Net open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be calculated based on the guidance in the 2019 FSIs Guide. Capital should be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.  Concepts:Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet (non-risk weighted) assets. For jurisdictions that have implemented the Basel III leverage ratio, the denominator also includes off-balance-sheet items. Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is risk-weighted assets also calculated based on Basel standards.  Nonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not going to be recovered. Only specific provisions for NPLs are used in this calculation and they refer to charges against the value of specific NPLs. Data exclude accrued interest on NPLs. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries’ supervisory practices. Nonperforming loans to total gross loans: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not going to be recovered. The denominator is the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific provisions for NPLs).  Return on assets: The numerator is annualized net income before taxes. The denominator is the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  Liquid assets to short-term liabilities:  Liquid assets include  currency and deposits and other financial assets available on demand or within three months as well as securities traded in liquid markets that can be converted into cash with minimal change in value. The denominator is short-term elements of debt liabilities plus net market value of financial derivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial derivatives liability position minus financial derivative asset position. Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining maturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity can be used as an alternative.  Net open position in foreign exchange to capital: Net open position should be calculated in accordance with the guidance in the 2019 FSIs Guide. The denominator is total regulatory capital as defined above."
132,Indicator10-6-1,Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations,"Definition:The indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations has two separate components: the developing country proportion of voting rights and the developing country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions, these two components are identical.The indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board.Concepts:There is no established convention for the designation of ""developed"" and ""developing"" countries or areas in the United Nations system. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the “historical” classification of “Developed regions” and “Developing regions” as of December 2021 in the United Nations M49 statistical standard. The removal of this classification from the M49 standard at the end of 2021 makes it more urgent to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG monitoring. The designations ""developed"" and developing"" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process."
133,Indicator10-7-1,Recruitment cost borne by employee as a proportion of monthly income earned in country of destination,"Definitions:SDG indicator 10.7.1 is defined as: “Recruitment cost borne by employee as a proportion of monthly income earned in country of destination”, i.e. a ratio between a cost measure and an income measure. The statistics used for the numerators and denominators for indicator 10.7.1 should be based on costs and earnings observed for the same individual international migrant worker.Concepts:Target population:   International migrant workers who, in a recent past period, changed their country of usual residence in order to work as wage or salary earners in another country, whether they were engaged through formal or through ‘informal’ recruitment processes.This includes international migrant workers and/or international return migrant workers, as per the country of measurement. Excluded are migrant workers who moved to a foreign country for self-employment purposes, short-term migrant workers who (are/were) employed in a foreign country for such short-periods that they (do/did) not change their usual residence (often taken as residence in a country for at least 12 months). Also excluded are persons who migrated to a destination country with intentions other than employment such as for leisure, tourism, family union, education and the like, even if they end up working in the foreign country at a later date, as they are not likely to incur recruitment costs since their primary motive for the move was not work related. However, employed persons who moved to a destination country with employment intentions but without work visas are covered. Reference period: the statistics/estimates on costs and earnings used to calculate 10.7.1 should refer to the first job obtained in the last country of destination, within a recent past period (e.g. 3 years prior to the date of measurement).Costs: Recruitment costs refer to any fees or costs incurred in the recruitment process in order for workers to secure employment or placement, regardless of the manner, timing or location of their imposition or collection. These are equal to the total amount that migrant workers and/or their families paid to find, qualify for, and secure a concrete job offer from a foreign employer and to reach the place of employment for the first job abroad. Recommended costs items are indicated in Paragraphs 22 to 24 of the draft Guidelines on statistics for SDG indicator 10.7.1.Earnings: The measure of earnings for the calculation of recruitment costs should be the monthly earnings in the first job held in the last destination country within the established recent past period. Monthly earnings should cover the actual income received for the first full month of employment within the reference period, including bonuses and other earnings (e.g. for over-time work). Adjustments should be made for any deductions for destination country taxes and social security contributions, as well as for any deductions in wages made to recover any recruitment costs initially paid by the employer."
134,Indicator10-7-2,"Proportion of countries with migration policies that facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people","Definitions:SDG Indicator 10.7.2 aims to describe the state of national migration policies and how such policies change over time. The information collected seeks to identify both progress made and gaps, thus contributing to the evidence base for actionable recommendations for the implementation of SDG target 10.7. The indicator also serves for the future thematic reviews at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The conceptual framework for indicator 10.7.2 is IOM´s Migration Governance Framework (MiGOF), which was welcomed by 157 countries (IOM Council Resolution C/106/RES/1310). The MiGOF has three principles and three objectives (figure 1). Figure 1. Principles and objectives of the Migration Governance FrameworkThe three principles propose the necessary conditions for migration to be well-managed by creating a more effective environment for maximized results for migration to be beneficial to all. These represent the means through which a State can ensure that the systemic requirements for good migration governance are in place. The three objectives are specific and do not require any further conventions, laws or practices than the ones that are already existing. Taken together, these objectives ensure that migration is governed in an integrated and holistic way, responding to the need to consider mobile categories of people and address their needs for assistance in the event of an emergency, building resilience of individuals and communities, as well as ensuring opportunities for the economic and social health of the State.In line with the MiGOF, the proposed methodology for SDG indicator 10.7.2 is comprised of six policy domains, with one proxy measure for each domain (table 1). Table 1. Domains and proxy measures for SDG indicator 10.7.2For each of the domains and corresponding proxy measures, one question was specified, each one of them informed by five sub-categories or responses (table 2), to capture key aspects of the range of migration policies at the national level, while allowing the indicator to detect relevant variations across countries and over time.Table 2. Questions and sub-categories for SDG indicator 10.7.2Concepts:SDG target 10.7 is broad in scope and many, but not all, of the terms are well defined. The IOM Glossary on Migration provides a definition of key concepts such as orderly and regular migration, but not others such as safe and responsible migration. According to the Glossary, orderly migration refers to “the movement of a person from his/her usual place of residence, in keeping with the laws and regulations governing exit of the country of origin and travel, transit and entry into the host country”. Regular is defined as “migration that occurs through recognized, legal channels”. While the concept of “well-managed migration policies” is not explicitly defined, according to the IOM Glossary, it is included in references to migration management, migration governance and facilitated migration. Migration management refers to the planned approach to the development of policy, and legislative and administrative responses to key migration issues. Migration governance is defined as a system of institutions, legal frameworks, mechanisms and practices aimed at regulating migration and protecting migrants. Facilitated migration refers to fostering or encouraging regular migration, for example through streamlined visa application process."
135,Indicator10-7-3,Number of people who died or disappeared in the process of migration towards an international destination,"Definitions:Data on SDG 10.7.3 are currently based on the International Organization for Migration (IOM)’s Missing Migrants Project (MMP) dataset, which since 2014 has documented incidents in which migrants (regardless of legal status) have died or are presumed to have died in the process of migration towards an international destination. This selection of data is based on the currently available sources and can provide some insight into the risks of migration routes.The MMP aims to provide information on the risks linked to unsafe and irregular international migration movements along key routes and corridors, and thus its definition of a migrant death excludes cases of migrants who die in countries where they have established residence. Deaths in refugee housing, immigration detention centres or camps are similarly excluded unless the death can clearly be linked to a hazard of the journey, e.g. a sickness contracted en route. MMP data also exclude deaths that occur after return to a migrant’s homeland or third country, as well as deaths more loosely connected with migrants’ precarious or irregular status, such as those resulting from labour exploitation, occupational illness or accidents Ior resulting from lack of access to health care. Disappearances of migrants en route in which there is no presumption of death (i.e. excluding shipwrecks and potential drownings) are also excluded.Data on SDG 10.7.3 are organized by the country in which the incidents occurred. If the incident took place at an international border or in international waters the country of departure is used.Concepts:(based on the IOM Glossary on Migration, 2019)Migrant: An umbrella term, not defined under international law, reflecting the common lay understanding of a person who moves away from his or her place of usual residence, whether within a country or across an international border, temporarily or permanently, and for a variety of reasons. The term includes a number of well-defined legal categories of people, such as migrant workers; persons whose particular types of movements are legally-defined, such as smuggled migrants; as well as those whose status or means of movement are not specifically defined under international law, such as international students.Irregular migration: Movement of persons that takes place outside the laws, regulations, or international agreements governing the entry into or exit from the State of origin, transit or destination."
136,Indicator10-7-4,"Proportion of the population who are refugees, by country of origin","Definition:The indicator is defined as the total count of population who have been recognized as refugees as a proportion of the total population of their country of origin, expressed per 100,000 population. Refugees refers to persons recognized by the Government and/or UNHCR, those in a refugee-like situation and other persons in need of international protection. Population refers to total resident population in a given country in a given year.Concepts:Refugees recognized by the Government and/or UNHCR include: (a) persons recognized as refugees by Governments having ratified the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and/or its 1967 Protocol; (b) persons recognized as refugees under the 1969 Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa; (c) those recognized in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Cartagena Declaration; (d) persons recognized by UNHCR as refugees in accordance with its Statute (otherwise referred to as “mandate” refugees); (e) those who have been granted a complementary form of protection (i.e. non-Convention); (f) persons who have been granted temporary protection on a group basis; Persons in a refugee-like situation refer to those outside their territory of origin who face protection risks similar to those of refugees, but who, for practical or other reasons, have not been formally recognized or issued documentation to that effect. Other persons in need of international protection are defined as people who are outside their country or territory of origin, typically because they have been forcibly displaced across international borders, who have not been reported under other categories (asylum-seekers, refugees, people in refugee-like situations) but who likely need international protection, including protection against forced return, as well as access to basic services on a temporary or longer-term basis."
137,Indicator10-a-1,Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff,"Definition:Proportion of total number of tariff lines (in per cent) applied to products imported from least developed countries and developing countries corresponding to a 0% tariff rate in HS chapter 01-97.Concepts:Tariff line or National Tariff lines (NTL): National Tariff Line codes refer to the classification codes, applied to merchandise goods by individual countries, that are longer than the HS six digit level. Countries are free to introduce national distinctions for tariffs and many other purposes. The national tariff line codes are based on the HS system but are longer than six digits. For example, the six digit HS code 010120 refers to Asses, mules and hinnies, live, whereas the US National Tariff line code 010120.10 refers to live purebred breeding asses, 010120.20 refers to live asses other than purebred breeding asses and 010120.30 refers to mules and hinnies imported for immediate slaughter.Tariffs: Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either on an ad valorem basis (percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7 per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs."
138,Indicator10-b-1,"Total resource flows for development, by recipient and donor countries and type of flow (e.g. official development assistance, foreign direct investment and other flows)","Definition:Total resource flows for development, by recipient and donor countries and type of flow comprises of Official Development Assistance (ODA), other official flows (OOF) and private flows.Concepts:Official and private flows, both concessional and non-concessional to developing countries. For official flows the major distinction is between official development assistance (ODA) and other official flowsOOF, while private flows are broken down into flows at market terms and charitable grants. Flows include contributions to multilateral development agencies, which are themselves official bodies.See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)"
139,Indicator10-c-1,Remittance costs as a proportion of the amount remitted,"Definition:The target includes two components. The first component is that transaction costs for migrant remittances should be 3% or less by 2030. This transaction cost should be intended as “Global average total cost of sending $200 (or equivalent in local sending currency) and expressed as % of amount sent”. This indicator is readily available and published on a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the Remittance Prices Worldwide database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 receiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This should be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send money to the beneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in each corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements (including service quality, reach etc.), for which the average is 5% or less.Concepts:International remittance transfer. A cross-border person-to-person payment of relatively low value. The transfers are typically recurrent payments by migrant workers (who send money to their families in their home country every month). In the report, the term “remittance transfer” is used for simplicity (ie it is assumed the transfer is international).Remittance service. A service that enables end users to send and/or receive remittance transfers.Remittance service provider (RSP). An entity, operating as a business, that provides a remittance service for a price to end users, either directly or through agents. These include both banks and money transfer operators, as defined below.Money transfer operator (MTO). A non-deposit taking payment service provider where the service involves payment per transfer (or possibly payment for a set or series of transfers) by the sender to the payment service provider (for example, by cash or bank transfer) – i.e. as opposed to a situation where the payment service provider debits an account held by the sender at the payment service provider. MTOs may include both traditional players focusing on delivering funds in cash and innovative players which may adopt a variety of different business models for the delivery of the transactions.Price. The total cost to the end users of sending a remittance transfer (including the fees charged to the sender and the margin by which the exchange rate charged to the end users is above the current interbank exchange rate).Transparent service. A remittance service for which the sending cost can be split into its two components: transfer fee and foreign exchange margin. If a provider does not disclose the foreign exchange rate applicable to the transaction, then the service is considered not transparent. "
140,Indicator11-1-1,"Proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing","The nature of the housing sector with its institutions, laws and regulations, is one that touches every single aspect of the economy of a country and has interface with practically every social development sector. People living in adequate homes have better health, higher chances to improve their human capital and seize the opportunities available in urban contexts. At the same time, a housing sector that performs well acts as a ‘development multiplier’ benefiting complementary industries, contributing to economic development, employment generation, service provision and overall poverty reduction. Broadly, for every job in the house-building sector, an additional 1.5 to 2 jobs are generally created in the construction materials and other input industries. The contributions of housing to urban prosperity are also evident. The UN-Habitat City Prosperity Initiative reveals indicates that inadequate housing has negative effects on several other dimensions of urban prosperity. Urban contexts with housing conditions below average experience poorer equity and inclusion, reduced urban safety and livelihood opportunities, and have neglected connectivity and provision of public space.Inadequate housing thus remains a global urban sustainability challenge, but also development opportunity. At the same time, the thematic area of ‘adequate housing’ and especially the term ‘slums’ - are often highly politicized. More nuanced definitions of these terms would enable and support a more robust and measured debate, greater engagement by all key stakeholders and the development of specific recommendations for application within each context and place.  There are a number of interrelated terms that must be grappled with when considering an indicator for the SDG Target 11.1. They include inadequate housing and housing affordability, informal settlements and slums. Housing affordabilityOne of the most daunting challenges of urbanization globally has been the provision of adequate housing that people can afford. Findings from the UN Global Sample of Cities show that people across all types of urban centres are not able to afford home ownership or even the cost of rental housing. In low-income countries for example, households need to save the equivalent of nearly eight times their annual household income in order to be able to afford the price of a standard house in their town or city. If they rent, households have to commit more than 25 per cent of their monthly income to rent payments. The affordability issue is affecting the developing and developed worlds alike. In Latin America, high house price-to-income ratio and inaccessible housing finance compel households to resort to informal solutions without the benefits of planning and safety regulations. In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, less than 10 per cent of households are able to afford a mortgage for even the cheapest newly built house. In fact, African households face 55 per cent higher housing costs relative to their per capita GDP than in other regions. In many European countries, families, especially the youth, are severely cost burdened and have much less to spend on other necessities such as food, health, transport and clothing. In extreme circumstances, households are forced to leave their accommodation because of the inability to pay. The current migration crisis has worsened housing conditions in the region, a trend that seems set to continue in the next few years.Inadequate housing, informal settlements and slumsToday, an estimated 1.6 billion people live in inadequate housing globally, of which 1 billion live in slums and informal settlements. This means that about one in four people in cities live in conditions that harm their health, safety, prosperity and opportunities. Lack of access to basic services is a common constraint in informal settlements and slums: worldwide 2.4 billion people live without improved sanitation and 2 billion are affected by water stress. In spite of a decrease from 39 to 30 per cent of urban population living in slums between 2000 and 2014, absolute numbers continue to grow: currently, one quarter of the world’s urban population is estimated to live in slums, 881 million urban residents as opposed to 792 million in 2000.  Young women- and children-headed households are often the most vulnerable to inadequate housing conditions. Homelessness is also a growing challenge and it is estimated that more than 100 million people worldwide are homeless.Slums represent one of the most extreme forms of deprivation and exclusion and remain a critical factor for the persistence of poverty and exclusion in the world – indeed a challenge for sustainable and inclusive urbanization. Research shows that other forms of urban poverty in the form of informal settlements increasingly become a worldwide phenomenon found also in the developed world.At the same time, not all people who live in inadequate housing live in slums but are nonetheless living in very substandard conditions in the urban contexts in which they are situated. The nature of these unsatisfactory living conditions must be captured and better represented in the global, country and city-level data to ensure a more robust picture of inadequate housing is documented. In light of this, the following definitions are proposed.Definition and concept: As per the 2030 Agenda, it is necessary to identify and quantify the proportion of the population that live in slums, informal settlements and those living in inadequate housing in order to inform the development of the appropriate policies and programmes for ensuring access for all to adequate housing and the upgrading of slums. a. Slums – An expert group meeting was convened in 2002 by UN-Habitat, the United Nations Statistics Division and the Cities Alliance to agree on an operational definition for slums to be used for measuring the indicator of MDG 7 Target 7.D. The agreed definition classified a ‘slum household’ as one in which the inhabitants suffer one or more of the following ‘household deprivations’:Lack of access to improved water source,Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities, Lack of sufficient living area, Lack of housing durability and,Lack of security of tenure. By extension, the term ‘slum dweller’ refers to a person living in a household that lacks any of the above attributes.These five components –all derived from the adequate housing’s definition have been used ever since for reporting and tracking of the MDGs, as the primary or secondary data measured to determine the number of slum dwellers living in developing countries. They were also the basis to establish the successful achievement of MDG Target 7.D. For each component, the experts agreed with the following sub-definitions:1) Access to improved water – A household is considered to have access to improved drinking water if the household members use a facility that is protected from outside contamination, in particular from faecal matters’ contamination. Improved drinking water sources include: piped water into dwelling, plot or yard; public tap/stand pipe serving no more than 5 households; protected spring; rainwater collection; bottled water (if secondary source is also improved); bore hole/tube well; and, protected dug well.2) Access to improved sanitation – A household is considered to have access to improved sanitation if household members have access to a facility with an excreta disposal system that hygienically separates human waste from human contact. Improved facilities include: flush/pour-flush toilets or latrines connected to a sewer, septic tank or pit; ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with a slab or platform, which covers the pit entirely; and, composting toilets/latrines.3) Sufficient living area /overcrowding– A dwelling unit provides sufficient living area for the household members if not more than three people share the same habitable room. Additional indicators of overcrowding have been proposed: area-level indicators such as average in-house living area per person or the number of households per area. Additionally, housing-unit level indicators such as the number of persons per bed or the number of children under five per room may also be viable. However, the number of persons per room has been shown to correlate with adverse health risks and is more commonly collected through household survey.. UN-Habitat believes that the definition as it stands does not reflect the practical experience of overcrowding and as noted below, is proposing an alternative. Figure 1- Example of Overcrowding4) Structural quality/durability of dwellings – A house is considered as ‘durable’ if it is built on a non-hazardous location and has a permanent and adequate structure able to protect its inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions such as rain, heat, cold, and humidity. The following criteria are used to determine the structural quality/durability of dwellings: permanency of structure (permanent building material for the walls, roof and floor; compliance with building codes; the dwelling is not in a dilapidated state; the dwelling is not in need of major repair); and location of house (hazardous location; the dwelling is not located on or near toxic waste; the dwelling is not located in a flood plain; the dwelling is not located on a steep slope; the dwelling is not located in a dangerous right of way: rail, highway, airport, power lines).5) Security of tenure – Secure tenure is the right of all individuals and groups to effective protection by the State against forced evictions. Security of tenure is understood as a set of relationships with respect to housing and land, established through statutory or customary law or informal or hybrid arrangements, that enables one to live in one’s home with security, peace and dignity (A/HRC/25/54). Regardless of the type of tenure, all persons with security of tenure have a legal status against arbitrary unlawful eviction, harassment and other threats. People have secure tenure when: there is evidence of documentation that can be used as proof of secure tenure status; and, there is either de facto or perceived protection from forced evictions. Important progress has been made to integrate the measurement of this component into the computation of the people living in slums.Informal Settlements b. Informal Settlements – Informal settlements are usually seen as synonymous of slums, with a particular focus on the formal status of land, structure and services. They are defined by three main criteria, according to Habitat III Issue Paper #22, which are already covered in the definition of slums. These are: Inhabitants have no security of tenure vis-à-vis the land or dwellings they inhabit, with modalities ranging from squatting to informal rental housing, The neighbourhoods usually lack, or are cut off from, formal basic services and city infrastructure, and The housing may not comply with current planning and building regulations, is often situated in geographically and environmentally hazardous areas, and may lack a municipal permit. Informal settlements can be occupied by all income levels of urban residents, affluent and poor.   Inadequate Housingc. Inadequate Housing – Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes housing as one of the components of the right to adequate standards of living for all. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’ general comments No.4 (1991) on the right to adequate housing and No.7 (1997) on forced evictions have underlined that the right to adequate housing should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity. For housing to be adequate, it must provide more than four walls and a roof, and at a minimum, meet the following criteria: Legal security of tenure, which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment and other threats; Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, including safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, energy for cooking, heating, lighting, food storage or refuse disposal; Affordability, as housing is not adequate if its cost threatens or compromises the occupants’ enjoyment of other human rights; Habitability, as housing is not adequate if it does not guarantee physical safety or provide adequate space, as well as protection against the cold, damp, heat, rain, wind, other threats to health and structural hazards; Accessibility, as housing is not adequate if the specific needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups are not taken into account (such as the poor, people facing discrimination; persons with disabilities, victims of natural disasters); Location, as housing is not adequate if it is cut off from employment opportunities, health-care services, schools, childcare centres and other social facilities, or if located in dangerous or polluted sites or in immediate proximity to pollution sources; andCultural adequacy, as housing is not adequate if it does not respect and take into account the expression of cultural identity and ways of life."
141,Indicator11-2-1,"Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","Definitions:This indicator will be monitored by the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport. The access to public transport is considered convenient when a stop is accessible within a walking distance along the street network of 500 m from a reference point such as a home, school, work place, market, etc. to a low-capacity public transport system (e.g. bus, Bus Rapid Transit) and/or 1 km to a high-capacity system (e.g. rail, metro, ferry). Additional criteria for defining public transport that is convenient include:a. Public transport accessible to all special-needs customers, including those who are physically, visually, and/or hearing-impaired, as well as those with temporary disabilities, the elderly, children and other people in vulnerable situations.b. Public transport with frequent service during peak travel timesc. Stops present a safe and comfortable station environmentConcepts:This indicator will be monitored by the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport. Because most public transport users walk from their trip origins to public transport stops and from public transport stops to their trip destination, local spatial availability and accessibility is sometimes evaluated in terms of pedestrian (walk) access, as opposed to park and ride or transfers.Hence, the access to public transport is considered convenient when an officially recognized stop is accessible within a walking distance along the street network of 500 m from a reference point such as a home, school, work place, market, etc. to a low-capacity public transport system (e.g. bus, Bus Rapid Transit) and/or 1 km to a high-capacity system (e.g. rail, metro, ferry).   Additional criteria for defining public transport that is convenient include:a. Public transport accessible to all special-needs customers, including those who are physically, visually, and/or hearing-impaired, as well as those with temporary disabilities, the elderly, children and other people in vulnerable situations.b. Public transport with frequent service during peak travel timesc. Stops present a safe and comfortable station environmentThe following definitions are required to define and measure convenient access to public transport. City or urban area: Since 2016 UN-Habitat and partners organized global consultations and discussions to narrow down the set of meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and reporting process. Following consultations with 86 member states, the United Nations Statistical Commission, in its 51st Session (March 2020) endorsed the Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) as a workable method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical comparisons.  This definition combines population size and population density thresholds to classify the entire territory of a country along the urban-rural continuum, and captures the full extent of a city, including the dense neighbourhoods beyond the boundary of the central municipality. DEGURBA is applied in a two-step process: First, 1 km2 grid cells are classified based on population density, contiguity and population size. Subsequently, local units are classified as urban or rural based on the type of grid cells in which majority of their population resides. For the computation of indicator 11.2.1, countries are encouraged to adopt the degree of urbanisation to define the analysis area (city or urban area).Public transport is defined as a shared passenger transport service that is available to the general public and is provided for the public good.  It includes cars, buses, trolleys, trams, trains, subways, and ferries that are shared by strangers without prior arrangement. It may also include informal modes of transport (para-transit) - but it is noted that these are often lacking in designated routes or stops.For a city to understand the nature of its transport system and in turn make the necessary planning and investment decisions, it is recommended to do an inventory of its public transport modes including major characteristics. For cities where a mix of formal and informal transport systems exist, it is also recommended to disaggregate the indicator findings by the share of population with access to each type of transport system, which is critical for decision-making processes. Recent data has shown that many cities in developing regions may lack a formal public transport system, but residents still enjoy a high level of access to public transport driven by a comprehensive paratransit network which does not necessarily have designated stops. A mapping of the transport routes where these paratransit networks can stop is thus recommended, and countries are encouraged to document each type of transport mode. Street Network is defined as a system of interconnected lines that represent a system of streets or roads for a given area. A street network provides the foundation for network analysis that will help to measure the pedestrian access/ walking distance of 500 m or 1 km to a public transport stop; or the network along which random informal transport modes can be accessed. Some cities have detailed data on their street network, type, street design (e.g. availability of a safe walking path) or topological structure of the network. However, if such data is not available, it is proposed to use OpenStreetMap as a baseline and fill missing gaps through digitizing of missing lines from satellite imagery (e.g. Google Earth). The major assumption in the use of these data sources is that all streets are walkable and on the same elevation level. Service Area, in the context of indicator 11.2.1 is defined as the area served by public transport within 500 m walking distance to a low capacity-system and/or 1 km to a high-capacity system based on the street network. Low-capacity public transport system, in the context of indicator 11.2.1 includes systems such as buses, trams, and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which largely run along the street network (including on dedicated lanes or tracks that follow the street network). These low-capacity public transport carriers are smaller in size and require less space for stopping-dropping-picking passengers (compared to high capacity carriers such as metros), meaning their stops can be provided within shorter distances to each other and along majority of the city streets. In countries where informal public transport systems are common, many paratransit services will fall under this category of public transport system. High-capacity public transport system, in the context of indicator 11.2.1 includes systems such as trains, metros and ferries. The carriers in this category of public transport system are large in size and require significantly large terminus infrastructure (eg metro stations) which makes it impossible to provide their stopping-dropping-picking stations (stops) within short distances. Majority of the carriers in this category also operate along dedicated infrastructure (eg metro-lines, waterways) and reach higher speeds than low capacity carriers. Several surveys have indicated that passengers are more likely to walk longer distances to access high-capacity than they would walk to access low-capacity public transport systems.   Built up area within the context of indicator 11.2.1 is defined as all areas occupied by buildings. "
142,Indicator11-3-1,Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate,"Definitions:The indicator is defined as the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate.This indicator requires defining the two components of population growth and land consumption rate. Computing the population growth rate is more straightforward and more readily available, while land consumption rate is slightly challenging, and requires the use of new techniques. In estimating the land consumption rate, one needs to define what constitutes “consumption” of land since this may cover aspects of “consumed” or “preserved” or available for “development” for cases such as land occupied by wetlands. Secondly, there is not one unequivocal measure of whether land that is being developed is truly “newly-developed” (or vacant) land, or if it is at least partially “redeveloped”. As a result, the percentage of current total urban land that was newly developed (consumed) will be used as a measure of the land consumption rate. The fully developed area is also sometimes referred to as built up area.Concepts:City or urban area: Since 2016 UN-Habitat and partners organized global consultations and discussions to narrow down the set of meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and reporting process. Following consultations with 86 member states, the United Nations Statistical Commission, in its 51st Session (March 2020) endorsed the Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) as a workable method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical comparisons.

DEGURBA is applied in a two-step process: First, 1 km2 grid cells are classified based on population density, contiguity and population size. Subsequently, local units are classified as urban or rural based on the type of grid cells in which majority of their population resides. For the computation of indicator 11.3.1, countries are encouraged to adopt the degree of urbanisation to define the analysis area (city or urban area).Population growth rate (PGR) is the change of a population in a defined area (country, city, etc) during a period, usually one year, expressed as a percentage of the population at the start of that period. It reflects the number of births and deaths during a period and the number of people migrating to and from the focus area. In SDG 11.3.1, this is computed at the area defined as urban/city.   Land consumption within the context of indicator 11.3.1 is defined as the uptake of land by urbanized land uses, which often involves conversion of land from non-urban to urban functions.  Land consumption rate is the rate at which urbanized land or land occupied by a city/urban area changes during a period of time (usually one year), expressed as a percentage of the land occupied by the city/urban area at the start of that time. Built up area within the context of indicator 11.3.1 is defined as all areas occupied by buildings. "
143,Indicator11-3-2,Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically,"Definition:Civil society organizations (CSOs) make a difference in international development. They provide development services and humanitarian relief, innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and advocate with and for the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and sustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more effectively. The development of sustainable human settlements calls for the active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular attention to project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups.  Therefore local and national governments should strive to: a) facilitate and protect people’s participation and civic engagement through independent civil society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national, and international; b) promote civic and human rights education and training programmes to make urban residents aware of their rights and the changing roles of diverse women, men, and young women and men in urban settings; c) remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups and promote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women, young men and women and marginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully, it is important to define cities as unique entities and define what constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning and management are more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on developing for the last few decades and these are well articulated in the urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological developments of this indicator have therefore put forth the below definitions to help guide the work on this indicator.Concepts:City or urban area: Since 2016 UN-Habitat and partners organized global consultations and discussions to narrow down the set of meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and reporting process. Following consultations with 86 member states, the United Nations Statistical Commission, in its 51st Session (March 2020) endorsed the Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) as a workable method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical comparisons.

DEGURBA is applied in a two-step process: First, 1 km2 grid cells are classified based on population density, contiguity and population size. Subsequently, local units are classified as urban or rural based on the type of grid cells in which majority of their population resides. Other conceptsDemocratic participation: Structures allow and encourage participation of civil society representing a cross-section of society that allows for equal representation of all members of the community with equal rights for participation and voting. Direct participation: Structures allow and encourage civil society accessing and actively engaging in decision-making, without intermediaries, at every stage of the urban planning and management process.Regular participation: Structures allow and encourage civil society participation in urban planning and management processes at every stage, and at least every six months.Marginalized groups: Groups of people that are not traditionally given equal voice in governance processes. These include, but are not limited to, women, young men and women, low-income communities, ethnic minorities, religious minorities, people with disabilities, the elderly, and sexual and gender identity minorities and migrants.Structures: Any formal structure that allows for participation of civil society. This can include, but is not limited to national or local legislation, policy, town council meetings, websites, elections, suggestion boxes, appeals processes, notice period for planning proposals etc. Civil Society: The combination of non-governmental organizations, community groups, community-based organizations, regional representative groups, unions, research institutes, think tanks, professional bodies, non-profit sports and cultural groups, and any other groups that represent the interests and wills of the members and wider community. Urban Management: The officials, including elected officials and public servants, that are responsible for city-management, across all sectors, such as roads, water, sanitation, energy, public space, land title etc.Urban Budget decision making: The process by which money is allocated to various sectors of urban management, including roads, roads, water, sanitation, energy, public space, land title etc.Urban Planning, including Design and Agreements: The technical and political process that concerns the development and use of land, how the natural environment is used etc. Design includes over-arching and specific design of public space, as well as zoning and land use definitions. Agreements refer to specific contract/arrangements made with various groups in regard to their land, e.g. Indigenous groups, protected natural environments etc."
144,Indicator11-4-1,"Total per capita expenditure on the preservation, protection and conservation of all cultural and natural heritage, by source of funding (public, private), type of heritage (cultural, natural) and level of government (national, regional, and local/municipal)","Definition
Total funding from government (central, regional, local), private sources (household, corporate & sponsorship and international sources) in the preservation, protection and conservation of cultural and/or natural heritage for a given year per capita. The results should be express in Purchasing Power Parities (PPP) in constant $. Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that try to equalise the purchasing power of different currencies, by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries. The basket of goods and services priced is a sample of all those that are part of final expenditures: final consumption of households and government, fixed capital formation, and net exports. This indicator is measured in terms of national currency per USD dollar. (OECD)ConceptsCultural heritage: includes artefacts, monuments, a group of buildings and sites, museums that have a diversity of values including symbolic, historic, artistic, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological, scientific and social significance. It includes tangible heritage (movable, immobile and underwater), intangible heritage (ICH) embedded into cultural, and natural heritage artefacts, sites or monuments. The definition excludes ICH related to other cultural domains such as festivals, celebration etc. It covers industrial heritage and cave paintings. Mixed heritage that refer to sites containing elements of both natural and cultural significance are including in cultural heritage.Natural heritage: refers to natural features, geological and physiographical formations and delineated areas that constitute the habitat of threatened species of animals and plants and natural sites of value from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty. It includes private and publically protected natural areas, zoos, aquaria and botanical gardens, natural habitat, marine ecosystems, sanctuaries and reservoirs.Conservation of cultural heritage refers to the measures taken to extend the life of cultural heritage while strengthening transmission of its significant heritage messages and values. In the domain of cultural property, the aim of conservation is to maintain the physical and cultural characteristics of the object to ensure that its value is not diminished and that it will outlive our limited time span.Conservation of natural heritage refers to the protection, care, management and maintenance of ecosystems, habitats, wildlife species and populations, within or outside of their natural environments, in order to safeguard the natural conditions for their long-term permanence.The aim of Preservation is to obviate damage liable to be caused by environmental or accidental factors, which pose a threat in the immediate surroundings of the object to be conserved. Accordingly, preventive methods and measures are not usually applied directly but are designed to control the microclimatic conditions of the environment with the aim of eradicating harmful agents or elements, which may have a temporary or permanent influence on the deterioration of the object.Protection: is the act or process of applying measures designed to affect the physical condition of a property by defending or guarding it from deterioration, loss or attack, or to cover or shield the property from danger or injury. In the case of buildings and structures, such treatment is generally of a temporary nature and anticipates future historic preservation treatment; in the case of archaeological sites, the protective measure may be temporary or permanent.Public expenditure refers to spending on heritage incurred by public funds.  Public funds are state, regional and local government bodies (Adapted from OECD glossary). Expenditure that is not directly related to cultural and natural heritage is, in principle, not included. Public expenditure in the preservation, protection and conservation of national cultural and/or natural heritage covers direct expenditure (including subsides), transfers and indirect public expenditures including tax incentives.Direct public expenditure includes subsidies, grants and awards. Direct expenditure comprises generally spent on personnel, goods and services, capital investment and other heritage activities. A Transfer is a transaction in which one institutional unit provides a good, service, or asset to another unit without receiving from the latter any good, service, or asset in return as a direct counterpart (IMF, 2014). Net Intergovernmental transfers are net transfers of funds designated for heritage activities from one level of government to another.Indirect public expenditures include tax incentives– reduction of taxable income that arises due to several of heritage expenses incurred by a taxpayer.National/Federal level consists of the institutional units of central government and non-market institutions controlled by central government. Central government expends their authority over the entire territory of country. It is responsible for providing heritage services for the benefit of the community as a whole, but also it may make transfers to other institutional units, as well levels of government.Regional/State/Provincial level is a subdivision of government, which shares political, fiscal and economic power with central government. In federal government, regional level is represented by state government. In unitary states, regional government is known as a provincial government. This level of government consists of institutional units, which have some of the functions of government at a level below of that of central government and above the local level. A regional government usually has the fiscal authority to raise taxes within its territory and has the ability to spend at least some of its income according to its own policies, and appoint or elect its own officers.If a regional unit is fully dependent on funds from the central government and a central government determines those funds, expenditures on regional level should be treated as a part of central government for statistical purposes.Local/municipal level is a public administration that exists at the lowest administration level within government state such as municipality of district. Local level refers to local government units, which consist of local government institutional units and nonmarket institutions controlled by local level. A local government often has the fiscal authority to raise taxes within its territory and should have the ability to spend at least some of its income according to its own policies, and appoint or elect its own officers.Total Public expenditure on heritage is consolidated expenditure on heritage made by national/federal, regional/States/Provincial and local governments. Private heritage expenditure refers to privately funded preservation, protection and conservation of national cultural and/or natural heritage and includes, but is not limited to: donations in kind, private non-profit sector and sponsorship. Private funding includes donations by individual and legal entities, donations by bilateral and multilateral funds such as Official Development Aid (ODA), income from admissions/selling services and goods to individual and legal entities and corporate sponsorship.Donation refers to cash and gifts-in-kind given by a physical or legal entity. Donations can be in the form of cash and in kind donations. Cash donations refer to the gift in money, payment checks or other monetary equivalents. Gifts-in-kind donations refer to donations in goods, services or other things such as supplies. Donations can be conditional or unconditional. Conditional donations are limited by the conditions imposed by the donor. Unconditional donations refer to the gift, which has no concrete purpose, given to organization/institution in order to help them in realization of their mission.Donations by individuals refer to cash and in kind donation given by individual or physical person. Donations by legal entity (corporation, enterprises) refer to any cash or in kind contributions given as a gift by legal entity – corporation, enterprises etc. This kind of donation is also known as a corporate philanthropy charitable giving to any organization/institution. Corporate sponsorships refer to financial or in kind contribution by business sector in exchange for benefits in the form of advertising, reputation, promotion etc. Corporate sponsorships represent some kind of marketing in which corporation pays to programme/project/event in exchange for some marketing benefits. Income from admissions/membership fees/ selling services and goods refers to amount of money received by entree sales to households / membership fees or selling services and goods to households or legal entities. Official Development Aid refers to the flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 percent (using a fixed 10 percent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (“bilateral ODA”) and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies—with the pure purpose of export promotion is excluded. (OECD).Donations by bilateral and multilateral sources refer to any cash and in kind contribution given to another organization as a gift by bilateral party (foreign states) or multilateral party (international body, organization, etc.). It can be in the form of development assistance or official development assistance or private international/foreign donation. Private bilateral/multilateral donation is financial aid given by private foundation from one foreign country or private foundations from several foreign countries. Total heritage expenditure refers to private and public spending on conservation, protection and preservation of heritage. Total expenditure comprises public and private expenditure for natural and cultural heritage. Using the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities Revision 4 (ISIC Rev. 4) classification, total heritage expenditure covers expenditures (public and private) for library and archives activities, museum activities and operation of historical sites and buildings as well resources invested in botanical and zoological gardens and nature reserve activities.

145,Indicator11-5-1,"Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population","Definition:This indicator measures the number of people who died, went missing or were directly affected by disasters per 100,000 population. Concepts:Death: The number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event.Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead, for whom there is no physical evidence such as a body, and for which an official/legal report has been filed with competent authorities.Directly affected:  The number of people who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected are people who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time, due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructure, basic services, commerce or work, or social, health and psychological consequences."
146,Indicator11-5-2,Direct economic loss attributed to disasters in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP),"Definition:This indicator measures the ratio of direct economic loss attributed to disasters in relation to GDP.Concepts:Economic Loss: Total economic impact that consists of direct economic loss and indirect economic loss.Direct economic loss: the monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Direct economic loss is nearly equivalent to physical damage.Indirect economic loss: a decline in economic value added as a consequence of direct economic loss and/or human and environmental impacts.Annotations: Examples of physical assets that are the basis for calculating direct economic loss include homes, schools, hospitals, commercial and governmental buildings, transport, energy, telecommunications infrastructures and other infrastructure; business assets and industrial plants; production such as crops, livestock and production infrastructure. They may also encompass environmental assets and cultural heritage.  Direct economic losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure."
147,Indicator11-5-3,"(a) Damage to critical infrastructure and (b) number of disruptions to basic services, attributed to disasters",Definition:Direct economic loss: the monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Direct economic loss is nearly equivalent to physical damage.[a] An open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework. These indicators will eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators.
148,Indicator11-6-1,"Proportion of municipal solid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out of total municipal waste generated, by cities","Definition:SDG 11.6 targets an improved environmental performance of cities and SDG indicator 11.6.1 measures the progress of the performance of a city’s municipal solid waste management. It quantifies the parameters listed below, which are essential for planning and implementing sustainable Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). In most cases, these variables are generally compatible with those collected through the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics (waste section).Total MSW generated in the city (tonnes/day)Total MSW collected in the city (tonnes/day)Proportion of population with access to basic MSW collection services in the city (%)Total MSW managed in controlled facilities in the city (tonnes/day)MSW compositionIt is important to realize that part (b) total MSW collected and (c) proportion of the population with access to basic MSW collection services are two different concepts. While part (b) refers to amounts of waste reaching waste management facilities, part (c) considers the population who receive waste collection services. In some cities it is common to dump waste ‘collected’ from households into the surrounding areas instead of transporting it to a disposal or recovery facility. In this case the household has waste collection services, but the collected waste is polluting the environment. Therefore, it is possible that a city has a high proportion of population with access to basic waste collection services, but the amount of MSW collected and transported to waste management facilities is low.Although part (c) is covered by SDG 1 (“End poverty in all its forms everywhere”), under target 1.4 and SDG indicator 1.4.1 which focuses on universal access to basic services, with a particular emphasis on poor and vulnerable groups, this document provides guidelines, quality ladders and household questionnaires to measure the proportion of the population with access to ‘basic’ MSW collection services. The household questionnaire can be integrated into the national census or global household survey mechanism such as Demographic and Health Survey or UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Due to the lack of standardized concepts and definitions that differentiate these two concepts, many cities report the proportion of collected MSW in their own terms. Therefore, this metadata distinguishes clearly between part (b) and (c) and offers introduction to the approaches to monitor and report on part (c). Concepts:Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)Municipal Solid Waste includes waste generated from: households, commerce and trade, small businesses, office buildings and institutions (schools, hospitals, government buildings). It also includes bulky waste (e.g. white goods, old furniture, mattresses) and waste from selected municipal services, e.g. waste from park and garden maintenance, waste from street cleaning services (street sweepings, the content of litter containers, market cleansing waste), if managed as waste. The definition excludes waste from municipal sewage network and treatment, municipal construction and demolition waste.GenerationTotal MSW Generated is the sum of the amount of municipal waste collected plus the estimated amount of municipal waste from areas not served by a municipal waste collection service.CollectionTotal MSW Collected refers to the amount of municipal waste collected by or on behalf of municipalities, as well as municipal waste collected by the private sector. It includes mixed waste, and fractions collected separately for recovery operations (through door-to-door collection and/or through voluntary deposits).Figure 1: What MSW collected means for SDG indicator 11.6.1The proportion of the population with Access to Basic MSW Collection Services is the proportion of the population who receive waste collection services that are either basic, improved or full, defined by the service ladder of MSW collection service. It considers aspects of frequency, regularity and proximity of the collection points (Table 1). This aspect is measured under the SDG indicator 11.6.1 assessment but it is reported through a different indicator, SDG 1.4.1. on access to basic services.Table 1: Ladder of MSW collection service that household receivesRecoveryRecovery means any operation the principal result of which is waste serving a useful purpose by replacing other materials which would otherwise have been used to fulfil a particular function, or waste being prepared to fulfil that function, in the plant or in the wider economy.Recovery facilities include any facility with recovery activities defined above including recycling, composting, incineration with energy recovery, materials recovery facilities (MRF), mechanical biological treatment (MBT), etc.Material Recovery Facility (MRF; or materials reclamation facility, materials recycling facility, multi re-use facility) is a specialized recovery facility that receives, separates and prepares recyclable materials for marketing to further processors or end-user manufacturers.Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) facilities are a type of recovery facility that combines an MRF with a form of biological treatment such as composting or anaerobic digestion.Incineration is the controlled combustion of waste with or without energy recovery.Incineration with Energy Recovery is the controlled combustion of waste with energy recovery.Recycling is defined under the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire and further for the purpose of these indicators as “Any reprocessing of waste material in a production process that diverts it from the waste stream, except reuse as fuel.  Both reprocessing as the same type of product, and for different purposes should be included. Recycling within industrial plants i.e., at the place of generation should be excluded.” For the purpose of consistency with the Basel Convention reporting and correspondence with EUROSTAT reporting system, Recovery operations R2 to R12 listed in Basel Convention Annex IV, are to be considered as ‘Recycling’ under the UNSD reporting for hazardous waste. Recycling value chain usually involves several steps of the private recycling industry which purchase, process and trade materials from the point a recyclable material is extracted from the waste stream until it will be reprocessed into products, materials or substances that have market value. In many low and low-to-middle income countries, this involves informal waste pickers, many middlemen, traders, apex traders and end-of-chain recyclers. Apex traders collect recyclable materials from different sources and suppliers (in different cities across municipal or even national boundaries) and supply them to different end-of-chain recyclers (sometimes after pre-processing such as sorting, washing and bailing).End-of-chain recyclers purchase recyclable material from suppliers such as apex traders and reprocess it into products, materials, or substances that have market value. Figure 2: Complexity in the recovery chain (plastic example)DisposalDisposal means any operation whose main purpose is not the recovery of materials or energy even if the operation has as a secondary consequence the reclamation of substances or energy. Disposal Facilities refer to sites which are regularly used by the public authorities and private collectors, regardless of their level of control and legality, to dispose of waste. Such sites may or may not have an official recognition, a permit or a license.  Disposal sites may be managed in either a controlled or uncontrolled manner. The definition excludes other unrecognized places where waste is deposited occasionally in small amounts which public authorities may organise clean ups to remove the waste from these sites.Landfill is the deposit of waste into or onto land. It includes specially engineered landfill sites and temporary storage of over one year on permanent sites. The definition covers both landfills at internal sites, i.e. where a generator of waste is carrying out its own waste disposal at the place of generation, and at external sites.Control level of MSW recovery and disposal facilitiesMSW Managed in Controlled Facilities refers to MSW collected and transported to recovery and disposal facilities with basic, improved or full control according to the Ladder of waste management facilities’ control level (Table 2: Ladder of waste management facilities’ control level.Table 2). The Ladder can be used as a checklist for assessing the level of control of a particular recovery or disposal facility. The facility has the level of control, where it checks the most boxes. Note that the emphasis is on operational control rather than engineering/design. A facility that is constructed to a high standard, but not operated in compliance with Level 3 (or above) standard is not regarded as a controlled facility.Table 2: Ladder of waste management facilities’ control level.Formality of MSWMThe Formality of MSWM activities is an important aspect to take into consideration when conducting the SDG indicator 11.6.1 assessment. MSWM activities are carried out by formal and informal economic units, both public and private, and by generators for the purpose of prevention, collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste.Formal waste management relates to waste management activities undertaken by units working within the context of the formal governmental or non-state actors regulating and operating waste management; that is, organisations or individuals registered as economic units with government authorities and assumed to generally abide by local laws and regulations related to wastes and their management. Informal waste management, recycling and recovery refers to waste management and recovery activities undertaken by individuals, economic units, or enterprises which are not sponsored, financed, recognised, supported, organised or acknowledged by the formal solid waste authorities, or which operate in violation of or in competition with formal authorities (Scheinberg et al., 2010). Informal units are assumed to abide by local waste-related laws and regulations when it is in their interests to do so."
149,Indicator11-6-2,Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted),"Definition:The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameters (PM2.5) is a common measure of air pollution. The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter [µg/m3]."
150,Indicator11-7-1,"Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","Definitions and Concepts:Indicator 11.7.1 has several interesting concepts that required global consultations and consensus. These include; built-up area, cities, open spaces for public use, etc. As a custodian agency, UN-Habitat has worked on these concepts along with several other partners.City: A range of accepted definitions of the “city” exist, from those based on population data and extent of the built-up area to those that are based solely on administrative boundaries. These definitions vary within and between nations, complicating the task of international reporting for the SDGs. Definitions of cities, metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations also vary depending on legal, administrative, political, economic or cultural criteria in the respective countries and regions. Since 2016UN-Habitat and partners organized global consultations and discussions to narrow down the set of meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and reporting process. Following consultations with 86 member states, the United Nations Statistical Commission, in its 51st Session (March 2020) endorsed the Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) as a workable method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical comparisons.  This definition combines population size and population density thresholds to classify the entire territory of a country along the urban-rural continuum, and captures the full extent of a city, including the dense neighbourhoods beyond the boundary of the central municipality. DEGURBA is applied in a two-step process: First, 1 km2 grid cells are classified based on population density, contiguity and population size. Subsequently, local units are classified as urban or rural based on the type of grid cells in which majority of their population resides. For the computation of indicator 11.7.1, countries are encouraged to adopt the degree of urbanisation to define the analysis area (city or urban area).Built-up area of cities: Conventionally, built up areas of cities are areas occupied by buildings and other artificial surfaces. For indicator 11.7.1, built up areas, as the indicator denominator has the same meaning as “city” (see definition of city above). Public space: The Global Public Space toolkit defines Public Space as all places that are publicly owned or of public use, accessible and enjoyable by all, for free and without a profit motive, categorized into streets, open spaces and public facilities. Public space in general is defined as the meeting or gathering places that exist outside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the public, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and proximity. This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places a focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship. For the purpose of monitoring and reporting on indicator 11.7.1, public space is defined as all places of public use, accessible by all, and comprises open public space and streets. Open public space: is any open piece of land that is undeveloped or land with no buildings (or other built structures) that is accessible to the public without charge, and provides recreational areas for residents and helps to enhance the beauty and environmental quality of neighbourhoods.  UN-Habitat recognizes that different cities have different types of open public spaces, which vary in both size and typology. Based on the size of both soft and hard surfaces, open public spaces are broadly classified into six categories: national/metropolitan open spaces, regional/larger city open spaces, district/city open spaces, neighbourhood open spaces, local/pocket open spaces and linear open spaces.  Classification of open public space by typology is described by the function of the space and can include: green public areas, riparian reserves, parks and urban forests, playground, square, plazas, waterfronts, sports field, community gardens, parklets and pocket parks. Potential open public space:  the identification of open public spaces across cities can be implemented through, among other sources, analysis of high to very high resolution satellite imagery, from base-maps provided by different organizations (eg OpenStreetMap, Esri, etc) or as crowd-sourced and volunteered data. While these sources provide important baseline data for indicator 11.7.1, some of the identifiable spaces may not meet the criteria of being “accessible to the public without charge”. The term “potential open public space” is thus used to refer to open public spaces which are extracted from the above-mentioned sources (based on their spatial character), but which are not yet validated to confirm if they are accessible to the public without charge.  Streets are defined thoroughfares that are based inside urban areas, towns, cities and neighbourhoods most commonly lined with houses or buildings used by pedestrians or vehicles in order to go from one place to another in the city, interact and to earn a livelihood. The main purpose of a street is facilitating movement and enabling public interaction. The following elements are considered as streets space: Streets, avenues and boulevards, pavements, passages and galleries, Bicycle paths, sidewalks, traffic island, tramways and roundabouts. Elements excluded from street space include plots (either built-up), open space blocks, railways, paved space within parking lots and airports and individual industries.Land allocated to streets refers to the total area of the city/urban area  that is occupied by all forms of streets (as defined above). This indicator only includes streets available at the time of data collection and excludes proposed networks.For more details and illustrations on the definition of the different types of open spaces considered for indicator 11.7.1 see SDG 11.7.1 step by step training module (https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2020/07/indicator_11.7.1_training_module_public_space.pdf)."
151,Indicator11-7-2,"Proportion of persons victim of physical or sexual harassment, by sex, age, disability status and place of occurrence, in the previous 12 months","Definition:Number of persons who have been victims of non-sexual harassment or sexual harassment, as a percentage of the total population of the relevant area.Concepts:The operational definitions of non-sexual and sexual harassment are based on the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS). While sexual harassment refers to a non-physical behaviour with a sexual connotation that is suitable to intimidate the victim, non-sexual harassment refers to all other non-sexual harassing behaviours that can cause fear for physical integrity and/or emotional distress. This type of non-sexual harassment formulated by the indicator overlaps to some extent with psychological violence.  The internationally standardized and tested SDG 16 Survey questionnaire and the accompanying Implementation Manual, which can be used by countries for collecting data SDG indicator 11.7.2 on non-sexual and sexual harassment, provide a core set of questions about specific behaviours that allow for the measurement of the prevalence of sexual and non-sexual harassment in the population (see Figures 1 and 2 below). In addition, the regionally standardized and tested methodology, the Latin America and the Caribbean Crime Victimization Survey Initiative (LACSI), offers a standardised methodology the measurement of indicator 11.7.2 and uses the same types of behaviours, both for non-sexual harassment and sexual harassment, but considering one additional behaviour indicative of sexual harassment: Somebody followed you and made you feel uncomfortable with sexual intentions.While the precise formulation and wording of the pertinent survey questions may need national customization, a core set of behaviours have been identified as forms of sexual and non-sexual harassment exercised towards a person: Figure 1: Types of non-sexual harassment included in the SDG 16 survey questionnaireSource: SDG 16 Survey questionnaireFigure 2: Types of sexual harassment included in the SDG 16 survey questionnaireSource: SDG 16 Survey questionnaire. Note: In relation to item E. ""inappropriately close"" means that the perpetrator is at a distance where he/she can touch the victim, but where physical contact does not take place.The SDG 16 survey instrument, developed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), is designed as a flexible tool that can be adapted to national needs. It can either be applied as a standalone population survey or, if necessary, countries can implement selected modules as part of other ongoing survey operations.The LACSI survey instrument, developed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), is designed as an independent crime victimization survey that can be adapted to the national needs and covers a wide range of criminal behaviors, including sexual and non-sexual harassment.  "
152,Indicator11-a-1,Number of countries that have national urban policies or regional development plans that (a) respond to population dynamics; (b) ensure balanced territorial development; and (c) increase local fiscal space,"Definition:National Urban Policies and regional development plans: A National Urban Policy (NUP) is defined as a coherent set of decisions or principle of actions derived through a deliberate government led process of coordinating and rallying various actors for a common vision and goal that will promote more transformative, productive, inclusive, and resilient urban development for the long term. This standard definition is extended and adapted to country contexts and may include, where applicable terms such as National Urban Plan, Framework, or Strategy as long as they are aligned with the above qualifiers. Similarly, regional development plans follow the same definition, only applied at the subnational level. NUP that responds to population dynamics:  This first qualifier examines to what extent the NUP addresses issues to do with population composition, trends and projections in achieving development goals and targets. Population composition includes size, geographic distribution and density, household size and composition, mobility and migration, age and sex distribution and disaggregation, as specified in SDG target 17.18 Trends are changes in composition of the population from over time Projections are expected changes over time that the NUP needs to ensure that they are well addressed.Key questions for the assessment: To what extent are quality and timely data on urban and rural population composition, trends and projections available for use in the development, implementation and monitoring of NUP or Regional Development Plans (RDPs)? To what extent do the strategies/interventions of the NUP and/or RDPs refer to population composition, trends and projections over the timeframe of the plan? Ensure balanced territorial development:  This second qualifier entails the promotion of a spatially coherent territory that includes a balanced system of human settlements including cities and towns and including urban corridors; that addresses social, economic, environmental and spatial disparities particularly considering the urban-rural continuum. Key questions for the assessment: To what extent does the national urban policy consider the need for balanced development of the territory as a whole including the differentiated yet equivalent development of all types of settlements including villages, cities and towns, including urban corridors? To what extent are the linkages – social, economic, environmental and spatial – between urban, peri-urban and rural areas consider with the ultimate goal of strengthening the urban-rural continuum? Increase local fiscal space: Local fiscal space is understood as the sum of financial resources available for improved delivery of basic social and economic services at the local level as a result of the budget and related decisions by governments at all levels without any prejudice to the sustainability of a government’s financial position. Key questions for the assessment: To what extent has the policy made allowance for the provision of local financial resources to provide for the implementation of the policy and for the delivery of essential basic social and economic services To what extent has the policy assessed the status of human capacities required to effectively use financial resources for the implementation of the policy and the delivery of essential basic social and economic services? Developing: Developing refers to the policy development pathways and processes that consider the feasibility, diagnosis of policy problems and opportunities, the formulation/drafting of the policy until the approval of the policy Implementing: Implementation refers to the realization of the policy proposal through legislative or financial action/commitments, including the continued monitoring and evaluation of that policy Concepts:Introducing NUP – an appropriate framework to achieve target 11.a and more broadly a recognized tool of implementation and monitoring of global urban agendas – along with regional development plans, and adding three measurable qualifiers as requirements for successful plans and policies, makes indicator 11.a.1 not only a more adequate, measurable and implementable process indicator for target 11.a.1, but also will serve more broadly the progress of SDGs and the new urban agenda. This revised indicator is indeed suitable for all countries and regions, and lends itself to regional analyses, as well as other forms of aggregation and disaggregation, according to development level, for example. It is also applicable at multiple territorial levels. Moreover, monitoring this indicator will help more broadly with NUP monitoring and help increase awareness, capacity and knowledge of best practices for sustainable urban policy in the process. Also, due to the multidisciplinary dimension of NUPs and their role in global agendas, the enhanced data collection and analysis capacity that would be permitted by this indicator revision would participate in guiding the necessary steps to create a more enabling urban policy environment to support SDG 11 and urban dimensions of other SDGs. NUP monitoring according to SDGs would for instance serve as a gap analysis to help formulate tailored recommendations and identify best practices."
153,Indicator11-b-1,Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030,Definition:[a] An open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework. These indicators will eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators.
154,Indicator11-b-2,Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies,"Definition:The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is: “Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”.In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience.The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG report A/71/644). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai Framework indicators."
155,Indicator12-1-1,"Number of countries developing, adopting or implementing policy instruments aimed at supporting the shift to sustainable consumption and production","Definitions:This indicator allows for the quantification (#) and monitoring of countries making progress along the policy cycle of binding and non-binding policy instruments aimed at supporting Sustainable Consumption and Production. Sustainable Consumption and Production: the working definition of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) used in the context of this framework is: “The use of services and related products, which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimising the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardise the needs of future generation.”Policy: although quite flexible and contexts specific, a policy is usually defined as a course of action that has been officially agreed by an entity or an organization (governmental or non-governmental) and is effectively implemented to achieve specific objectives.Policy instruments for sustainable consumption and production: policy instruments refer to the means – methodologies, measures or interventions – that are used to achieve those objectives. In the case of SCP, such instruments are designed and implemented to reduce the environmental impacts of consumption and production patterns, with a view of generating economic and/or social benefits. Making progress along the policy cycle refers to the development, adoption, implementation or evaluation of such policy instruments.  Concepts:As mentioned above, policy instruments are distinguished in legally binding policies and non-legally binding ones.Legally binding: a legally binding policy instrument refers to a system of rules, procedures and/or principles which are prescribed and enforced by a governing authority with the aim of requiring or preventing specific actions or providing incentives that lead to change in actions or preferences. It includes: laws, regulations, standards, by-laws, codes, etc. They can relate to different types of jurisdictions such as a ministry, state, municipality, or group of states. Non-binding: a non-binding policy instrument refers to a coherent set of decisions associated to a common vision, objective and/or direction, and to a proposed course of action to achieve these. It includes, for instance: action plans, policies, strategies, programmes, and projects. They can have different scopes of application (international, national, local, etc.).At another level, different categories of policy instruments can be distinguished:  Macro policies (e.g. national strategies/action plans, new institutions/entities)Regulatory and legal instruments (e.g. laws, standards, enforcement measures)Economic and fiscal instruments (taxes and tax incentives, grants, preferential loans, etc.) Voluntary and self-regulation schemes (e.g. sectoral partnerships, codes of conduct, CSR initiatives)It is important to note that, except for regulatory / legal instruments and voluntary / self-regulation schemes, the options above are not mutually exclusive: for instance, an economic instrument can be legally binding. “Policy cycle”: this political science concept is widely used to analyse and inform public policy-making processes, but can be transposed to any recurrent pattern leading to the implementation of a policy or policy instrument. The following approach with regards to the various stages of the policy cycle is adopted: Policy development, including Agenda setting (e.g. the problem identified is high enough on the public agenda that action becomes likely) and Policy design (e.g. setting objectives, identifying costs-benefits of potential policy instruments and selecting); Policy adopted or officially launched (e.g. adopting or authorizing the preferred policy options through the legislative process and refined through the bureaucratic process); Policy under implementation through specific actions (e.g. translating policy into concrete action and policy instruments); results and impacts are being monitored;Policy and related action plan has reached its end date and has been evaluated."
156,Indicator12-2-1,"Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP","Definitions:Material Footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material extraction to domestic final demand of a country. The total material footprint is the sum of the material footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic minerals. Concepts:Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) and MF need to be looked at in combination, as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final demand. A country can, for instance, have a very high DMC because it has a large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena. "
157,Indicator12-2-2,"Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP","Definitions:Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a national economy. DMC measures the total amount of material (biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metallic minerals) directly used in an economy and based on accounts of direct material flows, i.e., domestic material extraction and physical imports and exports.Concepts:DMC and Material Footprint (MF) need to be looked at in combination, as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and consumption. The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final demand.

158,Indicator12-3-1,(a) Food loss index and (b) food waste index,"Definitions:The Food Loss Index - Index of the changes in food loss over time covers five food groups along the supply chain. The indicator is computed as a ratio of Food Loss Percentages in the current year and the Food Loss Percentages in the base year according to a standard fixed-base index formula. This indicator complements SDG 12.3.1(b) on Food Waste (which is under the custodianship of UNEP). Both indicators look to divide the food value chain and measure the efficiency of the food system”.. Definition of food loss for SDG monitoring:Food losses - are all the crop and livestock human-edible commodity quantities that, directly or indirectly, completely exit the post-harvest/slaughter production/supply chain by being discarded, incinerated or otherwise, and do not re-enter in any other utilization (such as animal feed, industrial use, etc.), up to, and excluding, the retail level. Losses that occur during storage, transportation, and processing, also of imported quantities, are therefore all included. Losses include the commodity as a whole with its non-edible parts.Concepts:Food – Food - Any substance—whether processed, semi-processed, or raw—that is intended for human consumption. “Food” includes drink, and any substance that has been used in the manufacture, preparation, or treatment of food. “Food” also includes material that has spoiled and is therefore no longer fit for human consumption. It does not include cosmetics, tobacco, or substances used only as drugs.Food loss and waste (FLW) – is the decrease in quantity or quality of food. Quantitative food loss and waste – is the decrease in mass of food. Pre-harvest constitutes the time frame between maturity and harvesting. Harvest/slaughter/catch refers to the act of separating the food material from the site of immediate growth or production.Food Loss Index scope and boundariesThe scope of the Food Loss Index starts on the production site with postharvest/slaughter/catch operations up to but not including the retail level, in line with the Food Balance Sheets conceptual framework.The index covers five food groups and 10 key commodities set by countries. Harvest losses can be included in the index at the country level only. Pre-harvest losses are out of scope.Sub-Indicator 12.3.1(b) Food Waste Index covers food waste at the retail and consumption level.Figure 1.

159,Indicator12-4-1,"Number of parties to international multilateral environmental agreements on hazardous waste, and other chemicals that meet their commitments and obligations in transmitting information as required by each relevant agreement","Definitions:The indicator refers to the number of Parties (= countries that have ratified, accepted, approved, or accessed), to the following Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs):The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (Basel Convention); The Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (Rotterdam Convention);The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Stockholm Convention);The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol);Minamata Convention on Mercury (Minamata Convention),which have submitted the information to the Secretariat of each MEA, as required by each of the agreements. The information required is as follows:Basel Convention:Designation of the Focal Point and one or more Competent Authorities;Submission of the annual national reports.Rotterdam Convention:Designation of the Designated National Authority(ies) and Official contact points;Submission of the import responses. Stockholm Convention:Designation of the Stockholm Convention official contact points and national focal points;Submission of the national implementation plans; Submission of the revised national implementation plan addressing amendments; Submission of the national reports.Montreal Protocol:Compliance with annual reporting requirements for production and consumption of controlled substances under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol;Submission of information on Licensing systems under (Article 4B of) the Montreal Protocol;For each party, a percentage value is assigned to indicate how much of the required information has been submitted.Minamata Convention:Designation of a national focal point for exchange of information under Article 17 of the Convention;Submission of national reports as required under Article 21 of the Minamata Convention.Concepts:Parties to the Basel Convention have an obligation to present an annual national report as provided for by Article 13, paragraph 3 in order to enable monitoring of the implementation of the Basel Convention by its Parties. The reports are to contain, inter alia, information regarding transboundary movements of hazardous wastes or other wastes in which Parties have been involved, including the amount of hazardous wastes and other wastes exported, their category, characteristics, destination, any transit country and disposal method as stated on the response to notification, the amount of hazardous wastes and other wastes imported in their category, characteristics, origin, and disposal methods; information on accidents occurring during the transboundary movement and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes and on the measures undertaken to deal with them; information on disposal options operated within the area of their national jurisdiction; and other information as per reporting format.Import responses under the Rotterdam Convention are the decisions provided by Parties indicating whether or not they will consent to import the chemicals listed in Annex III of the Convention and subject to the prior informed consent (PIC) procedure. Article 10 of the Rotterdam Convention sets out the obligations of Parties with respect to the future import of chemicals listed in Annex III.Under the Stockholm Convention, a Party has an obligation to report on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention and on the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the objectives of the Convention. The national reports include statistical data on the total quantities of production, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable estimate of such data; and to the extent practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported each substance and the States to which it has exported each substance. A National Implementation Plan under the Stockholm Convention is a plan explaining how a Party is going to implement the obligations under the Convention and make efforts to put such a plan into operation (Article 7). Changes in the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention or its annexes, for example when a new chemical is listed into the annexes of the Convention, will require that a Party is to  review and update its implementation plan, and transmit the updated plan to the Conference of the Parties (COP) within two years of the entry into force of the amendment for it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention (according to paragraph 7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12). The Minamata Convention requires, under its article 17, paragraph 4, that each Party designates a National Focal Point for the exchange of information under it, including with regard to the consent of importing Parties under Article 3. Pursuant to Article 21 of the Minamata Convention, each party to the Convention shall report to the COP on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention, on the effectiveness of such measures and on possible challenges in meeting the objectives of the Convention. In decision MC-1/8 on the Timing and format of reporting by the Parties, the COP at its first meeting (2017) agreed on the full format of reporting and decided that each Party shall report every four years using the full format and report every two years on four questions marked by an asterisk in the full format. The COP further decided on the following timing with regards to the short and full reporting: 31 December 2019 as the deadline for the first  short national report; 31 December 2021 as the deadline for the first full national report. The Montreal Protocol requires, under its Article 7, that each Party provides to the Secretariat for each controlled substance statistical data on its annual production, amounts used for feedstocks, amounts destroyed by technologies approved by the Parties, imports from and exports to Parties and non-Parties respectively and amount of the controlled substance listed in Annex E used for quarantine and pre-shipment applications, for the year during which provisions concerning those substances entered into force for that Party and for each year thereafter. Each Party shall also provide to the Secretariat statistical data on its annual emissions of trifluoromethane (HFC-23) per facility. The calculation of control levels is provided in Article 3 of the Protocol. This reporting enables monitoring of the implementation of the Protocol, and compliance with the control measures under the protocol. Additionally, under Article 4B, each party is required to establish and implement a system for licensing the import and export of new, used, recycled and reclaimed controlled substances. Each Party is required, within three months of the date of introducing its licensing system, to report to the Secretariat on the establishment and operation of that system. "
160,Indicator12-4-2,"(a) Hazardous waste generated per capita; and (b) proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment","Definitions:The indicator includes hazardous generated, hazardous waste generated by type (including e-waste as a sub-indicator) and the proportion of hazardous waste treated. Hazardous waste is waste with properties capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment and is regulated and controlled by law.Hazardous waste generated:  refers to the quantity of hazardous waste generated within the country during the reported year, prior to any activity such as collection, preparation for reuse, treatment, recovery, including recycling, or export, no matter the destination of this waste.Hazardous waste generated by type, including e-waste: A breakdown of hazardous waste generated by key type of waste, including e-waste.Municipal waste: Municipal solid waste (MSW) includes waste originating from households, commerce and trade, small businesses, office buildings and institutions (schools, hospitals, government buildings). It also includes bulky waste (e.g., old furniture, mattresses) and waste from selected municipal services, e.g. waste from parks and gardens maintenance, waste from street cleaning services (street sweepings, litter containers content, market cleansing waste), if managed as waste.E-waste: Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to all items of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and its parts that have been discarded by its owner as waste without the intent of re-use.Hazardous waste treated: Hazardous waste treated during reporting year, per each type of treatment (recycling, incineration with/without energy recovery, landfilling or other), including exports and excluding imports.Concepts:Hazardous waste is waste with properties that make it hazardous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment. Hazardous waste is generated from many sources, ranging from industrial manufacturing process waste to domestic items such as batteries and may come in many forms, including liquids, solids, gases and sludge. They can be discarded as commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides or the by-products of manufacturing processes, from Basel Convention (Article 1, paragraph 1(a)). Waste listed in Annex VIII of the Basel Convention is presumed to be hazardous, while waste listed in Annex IX is presumed not to be hazardous. For the purpose of this indicator, due to comparability reasons, additional waste considered hazardous as per national definitions, as provided by the Basel Convention under Article 1, paragraph 1(b), are excluded.Hazardous waste generated refers to the quantity of hazardous waste (as per the definition above) that is generated within the country during the reported year, prior to any activity such as collection, preparation for reuse, treatment, recovery, including recycling, or export, no matter the destination of this waste. For waste that are not covered under the above definition, but are defined as, or are considered to be hazardous waste by national definitions and are included in the “hazardous waste generated” amount, a specific note should be added specifying the additional types/streams of hazardous waste included as well as their quantities. “Waste treated” and “type of treatment” are not defined in the Basel Convention. In this context, “treatment” will include all operations included under Annex IV of the Basel Convention, namely “Disposal” operations D1 to D15 and “Recovery” operations R1 to R13. This is also linked to the definitions of “Recycling, Incineration, Incineration with energy recovery, Landfilling and other types of treatment or disposal”.A full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled, “Global Chemicals and Waste Indicator Review Document” (UNEP, 2021)."
161,Indicator12-5-1,"National recycling rate, tons of material recycled","Definitions:National Recycling Rate is defined as the quantity of material recycled in the country plus quantities exported for recycling minus material imported intended for recycling out of total waste generated in the country. Note that recycling includes codigestion/anaerobic digestion and composting/aerobic process, but not controlled combustion (incineration) or land application.National recycling rate can be presented by type of waste, including e-waste, plastic waste, municipal waste, and others.Concepts: Material recycled expressed in tons, reported at the last entity in the recycling chain, preferably when tons of material is bought as secondary resource to be used in production facilities during the course of the reporting year; Secondary mineral materials used in the construction sector are excluded; composting is considered recycling for the purposes of this indicator.Recycling is defined under the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics and further for the purpose of these indicators as “Any reprocessing of waste material […] that diverts it from the waste stream, except reuse as fuel. Both reprocessing as the same type of product, and for different purposes should be included. Recycling within industrial plants i.e., at the place of generation should be excluded.”For the purpose of consistency with the Basel Convention reporting and correspondence with EUROSTAT reporting system, Recovery operations R2 to R12 listed in Basel Convention Annex IV, are to be considered as ‘Recycling’ under the UNSD reporting for hazardous waste. Total waste generated is the total amount of waste (both hazardous and non-hazardous) generated in the country during the year. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) includes waste originating from households, commerce and trade, small businesses, office buildings and institutions (schools, hospitals, government buildings). It also includes bulky waste (e.g., old furniture, mattresses) and waste from selected municipal services, e.g., waste from park and garden maintenance, waste from street cleaning services (street sweepings, the content of litter containers, market cleansing waste), if managed as waste. Further information on MSW is defined in the SDG indicator methodology for 11.6.1. Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to all items of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and its parts that have been discarded by its owner as waste without the intent of re-use."
162,Indicator12-6-1,Number of companies publishing sustainability reports,"Definitions:Sustainability Reports: For the purposes of this indicator, ‘sustainability reports’ will not be limited to stand-alone sustainability reports produced by companies, but will be considered as ‘reporting sustainability information’ and expanded to other forms of reporting sustainability information, such as publishing sustainability information as part of the company’s annual reports or reporting sustainability information to the national government. This is to ensure that the focus of the indicator is on tracking the publishing of sustainability information, rather than on the practice of publishing stand-alone sustainability reports. It also ensures that the indicator interpretation is aligned with the wording of Target 12.6 which refers to promoting “the integration of sustainability information into the annual reporting cycle of companies”. Company:While many companies report at the group level, many of their impacts will be local, and some subsidiaries or franchises produce separate sustainability reports. As a practice that should be encouraged, and one that is useful to monitor, it is therefore proposed to count both the group and subsidiary/franchise level separately, as separate entities. “Company” can therefore apply to either the parent company, or a franchise or subsidiary, depending on their reporting practices.Concepts:It is proposed that, to be counted towards the indicator, companies are encouraged to publish information that meets a “Minimum requirement” of disclosure. A core set of economic, environmental, social and governance disclosures of sustainability information is therefore identified. In defining these disclosure elements, the custodian agencies attempted to align with the disclosures that appear in existing related reporting frameworks, including the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) reporting framework, the Global Reporting Initiative Standard (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) (see Annex I for a comparison of the various sustainability disclosures contained under each.It also attempts to align with the UNCTAD Core Indicators for company reporting on the contribution towards the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. UNCTAD has prepared Guidance on Core indicators for entity reporting on the contribution towards the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to support entities in the provision of information under indicator 12.6.1 and governments in assessing the private sector contribution to the SDGs. The Guidance reflects the Agreed Conclusions of the thirty-fourth session of the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR), which in 2017 requested UNCTAD to develop the guiding document. The UNCTAD Guidance includes detailed definitions and data sources for the core indicators in the company accounts to assist the entities in the reporting.The purpose is not to create a new reporting standard or framework, but to ensure that the minimum reporting  recommendations for Indicator 12.6.1 are  aligned with existing global frameworks currently used by companies, so that they may continue to use these frameworks.While establishing a minimum recommendations  in terms of reporting enables companies disclosing meaningful information on all aspects of sustainability to be  counted towards the indicator, it could be perceived as giving the message that the minimum suffices and that companies do not need to go beyond it. Therefore, it is proposed that the methodology include an advanced level, with a further set of disclosure elements, which would further provide impetus for examining and reporting on the sustainability practices and impacts of the company. These include: 1) stakeholder engagement, 2) assessing impacts beyond the company boundaries and along the supply chain; 3) supplier and consumer engagement on sustainability issues; 4) procurement and sourcing practices; and 5) environmental performance information in the form of intensity values to be monitored over time, such as consumption of energy, water or materials per unit of production or per unit of profit.Having different levels will also allow for information to be collected on the degree of reporting of different companies, including whether the same companies produce more ambitious reports, and go further in their sustainability practices with time, such as through supplier engagement. It would allow for companies who are beginning to produce sustainability reports  to provide incentive, through their inclusion in the indicator count, for them to work towards more ambitious reporting and demonstrate their progress over time."
163,Indicator12-7-1,Number of countries implementing sustainable public procurement policies and action plans,"Definitions:The indicator measures the number of countries implementing Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP) policies and action plans, by assessing the degree of implementation through an index. To produce the index, countries self-assess the following main elements: - Public procurement legal and regulatory framework- Practical support delivered for the implementation of SPP- SPP priority products and corresponding sustainable procurement criteria - Existence of SPP monitoring system- Measurement of actual SPP outcomeMore details are provided in the attached SPP Index Methodology (revised February 2021).Concepts:Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP): Sustainable Public Procurement is a “A process whereby public organizations meet their needs for goods, services, works and utilities in a way that achieves value for money on a whole life cycle basis in terms of generating benefits not only to the organisation, but also to society and the economy, whilst significantly reducing negative impacts on the environment” (Definition updated by the Multistakeholder Advisory Committee of the 10YFP SPP Programme).Sustainable Public Procurement Action Plan: A Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP) action plan is a policy document articulating the priorities and actions a public authority will adopt to support the implementation of SPP. Plans usually/should address the economic, environmental and social dimensions of SPP, and recognise the potential for SPP to realise SDGs”. In some cases a country’s action plan may focus on a single aspect of sustainability, being either environmental (e.g. “Green” public procurement action plan), social (e.g. reference to human rights, fair trade, focus on employment of minorities, etc.), or economic (e.g. promotion of SMEs’ participation in tenders, focus on employment of minorities, etc.). Best Value for Money: can be defined as the “optimum combination of whole-life cost and quality to meet the end-user's requirements"".Life-cycle costing (LCC):  is used to evaluate costs which may not be reflected in the purchase price of a product, work or service, and which will be incurred during their lifetime.MEAT: The Most Economically Advantageous Tender criterion enables the contracting authority to take account of criteria that reflect qualitative, technical and sustainable aspects of the tender submission as well as price when reaching an award decision.More reference about the above and their contextualization can be found in the attached SPP Index Methodology."
164,Indicator12-8-1,Extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment,"Definition:Indicator 4.7.1/12.8.1/13.3.1 measures the extent to which countries mainstream Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in their education systems. This is an indicator of characteristics of different aspects of education systems:  education policies, curricula, teacher training and student assessment as reported by government officials, ideally following consultation with other government ministries, national human rights institutes, the education sector and civil society organizations. It measures what governments intend and not what is implemented in practice in schools and classrooms. For each of the four components of the indicator (policies, curricula, teacher education, and student assessment), a number of criteria are measured, which are then combined to give a single score between zero and one for each component. (See methodology section for full details).The indicator and its methodology have been reviewed and endorsed by UNESCO’s Technical Cooperation Group on the Indicators for SDG 4-Education 2030 (TCG), which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the thematic indicator framework for the follow-up and review of SDG 4. The TCG also has an interest in education-related indicators in other SDGs, including global indicators 4.7.1 and 13.3.1. The TCG is composed of 28 regionally representative experts from UNESCO Member States (nominated by the respective geographic groups of UNESCO), as well as international and regional partners and civil society. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics acts as the Secretariat.Concepts:Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) nurture respect for all, build a sense of belonging to a common humanity, foster responsibility for a shared planet, and help learners become responsible and active global citizens and proactive contributors to a more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world. They aim to empower learners of all ages to face and resolve local and global challenges and to take informed decisions and actions for environmental integrity, economic viability and a just society for present and future generations, while respecting cultural diversity."
165,Indicator12-a-1,Installed renewable energy-generating capacity in developing countries (in watts per capita),"Definition:The indicator is defined as the installed capacity of power plants that generate electricity from renewable energy sources divided by the total population of a country. Capacity is defined as the net maximum electrical capacity installed at the year-end and renewable energy sources are as defined in the IRENA Statute (see concepts below).Concepts:Electricity capacity is defined in the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics or IRES (UN, 2018) as the maximum active power that can be supplied continuously (i.e., throughout a prolonged period in a day with the whole plant running) at the point of outlet (i.e., after taking the power supplies for the station auxiliaries and allowing for the losses in those transformers considered integral to the station). This assumes no restriction of interconnection to the network. It does not include overload capacity that can only be sustained for a short period of time (e.g., internal combustion engines momentarily running above their rated capacity).The IRENA Statute defines renewable energy to include energy from the following sources: hydropower; marine energy (ocean, tidal and wave energy); wind energy; solar energy (photovoltaic and thermal energy); bioenergy; and geothermal energy."
166,Indicator12-b-1,Implementation of standard accounting tools to monitor the economic and environmental aspects of tourism sustainability,"Definitions: The indicator “Implementation of standard accounting tools to monitor the economic and environmental aspects of tourism sustainability” relates to the degree of implementation in countries of the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) and the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA) tables that are to date considered most relevant and feasible for monitoring sustainability in tourism. These tables are:TSA Table 1 on inbound tourism expenditureTSA Table 2 on domestic tourism expenditureTSA Table 3 on outbound tourism expenditureTSA Table 4 on internal tourism consumption TSA Table 5 on production accounts of tourism industriesTSA Table 6 domestic supply and internal tourism consumptionTSA Table 7 on employment in tourism industriesSEEA table water flowsSEEA table energy flowsSEEA table GHG emissionsSEEA table solid wasteThe TSA tables should be implemented following the Tourism Satellite Account: Recommended Methodological Framework 2008 and the environmental tables should be implemented following the System of Economic-Environmental Accounting 2012.Concepts:The concepts and template presentation tables related to Tourism Satellite Accounts can be found in the Tourism Satellite Account: Recommended Methodological Framework 2008 (TSA: RMF 2008) which provides the common conceptual framework for constructing a TSA. It adopts the basic system of concepts, classifications, definitions, tables and aggregates of the System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008). The UN Statistical Commission took note of the TSA: RMF 2008 document at its 39th session (26-29 February 2008), which updates and replaces the previous TSA: RMF 2000 that was approved by the United Nations Statistical Commission at its 31st session (29 February-3 March 2000).The concepts and template presentation tables related to water, energy, Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and solid waste can be found in System of Environmental-Economic Accounting - Central Framework (SEEA-CF). The SEEA-CF is an international statistical standard for measuring the environment and its relationship with the economy. It contains an internationally agreed set of standard concepts, definitions, classifications, accounting rules and tables to produce internationally comparable statistics. The UN Statistical Commission adopted the SEEA Central Framework at its 43rd session (28 February – 2 March 2012). "
167,Indicator12-c-1,Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies (production and consumption) per unit of GDP,"Definitions:In order to measure fossil fuel subsidies at the national, regional and global level, three sub-indicators are recommended for reporting on this indicator: 1) direct transfer of government funds; 2) induced transfers (price support); and as an optional sub-indicator 3) tax expenditure, other revenue foregone, and under-pricing of goods and services. The definitions of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO, 1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised descriptions from the United Nations Statistical Office’s Central Product Classification should be used to classify individual energy products. It is proposed to drop the wording “as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels” and thus this indicator is effectively ""Amount of fossil fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)"".Concepts:The concepts and definitions used in the methodology have been based on existing international frameworks and glossaries.Use definition of fossil fuels from the International Energy Agency (IEA) Statistics Manual, “Fossil fuels are taken from natural resources which were formed from biomass in the geological past. By extension, the term fossil is also applied to any secondary fuel manufactured from a fossil fuel.”Use the terms set out in the Central Product Classification (CPC), Rev. 2.1 for the statistical classification of the individual products. No other commonly accepted definition identified.Include electricity and heat generated from fossil fuels in the scope of fossil fuels. Include non-energy uses with monitoring optional	for the measuring of this indicator.Additional details are provided in the methodological document entitled, Measuring Fossil Fuel Subsidies in the Context of the Sustainable Development Goals."
168,Indicator13-1-1,"Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population","Definition:This indicator measures the number of people who died, went missing or were directly affected by disasters per 100,000 population. Concepts:Death: The number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event.Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead, for whom there is no physical evidence such as a body, and for which an official/legal report has been filed with competent authorities.Directly affected:  The number of people who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected are people who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time, due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructure, basic services, commerce or work, or social, health and psychological consequences."
169,Indicator13-1-2,Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030,Definition:NA[a] An open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework. These indicators will eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators.Concepts:
170,Indicator13-1-3,Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies,"Definition:The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. One of the targets is: “Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020”.In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience.The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG report A/71/644). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai Framework indicators.Concepts:"
171,Indicator13-2-1,"Number of countries with nationally determined contributions, long-term strategies, national adaptation plans and adaptation communications, as reported to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change","Definitions:NDCsThe Paris Agreement requires each Party to prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions (NDCs) including mitigation, adaptation and support measures. The Paris Agreement (Article 4, paragraph 2) requires each Party to prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that it intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.Starting in 2023 and then every five years, governments will take stock of the implementation of the Agreement to assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of the Agreement and its long-term goals. The outcome of the global stocktake (GST) will inform the preparation of subsequent NDCs, in order to allow for increased ambition and climate action to achieve the purpose of the Paris Agreement and its long-term goals. https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcsNDC interim registry https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/Pages/Home.aspx NAPsThe national adaptation plan (NAP) process was established under the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF). It enables Parties to formulate and implement national adaptation plans (NAPs) as a means of identifying medium- and long-term adaptation needs and developing and implementing strategies and programmes to address those needs. It is a continuous, progressive and iterative process which follows a country-driven, gender-sensitive, participatory and fully transparent approach supported by technical guidelines and up to USD 3 million per developing country through the Green Climate Fund Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme, intended to support the formulation of NAPs. Technical guidelines for the NAP process are available at <unfccc.int>; NAPs received by the UNFCCC secretariat are posted at <unfccc.int>.Long term strategies Under the Paris Agreement, all Parties should further strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies to provide a context and integrated long-term view to their NDCs. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement, all Parties should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, mindful of Article 2 taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.The COP, by its decision 1/CP 21, paragraph 35, invited Parties to communicate, by 2020, to the secretariat mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Agreement. Further information is available at <unfccc.int>Adaptation communicationsUnder the Paris Agreement’s Article 7, paragraphs 10 and 11,  each Party should, as appropriate, submit and update periodically an adaptation communication, which may include its priorities, implementation and support needs, plans and actions. The purpose of the adaptation communication is to strengthen the visibility and profile of adaptation, balance with mitigation, actions, support, learning and understanding. Parties may include information on e.g. their circumstances, institutions, vulnerabilities, adaptation priorities, plans, needs, progress achieved, co-benefits, other frameworks, gender aspects, and indigenous knowledge. The adaptation communications will be recorded in a public registry maintained by the secretariat, and they will provide input to the process of global stocktake every five years. The adaptation communications received so far are currently available at: https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/adaptation-communications.  National communicationsThe Convention established several processes to foster transparency and accountability of countries’ actions to address climate change. Under Article 12, all Parties are asked to submit national inventories and national communications (NCs) to report on the implementation of the Convention. This reporting is required at different levels of stringency and with varying frequency for different Parties. National Communications received by the UNFCCC secretariat are available at <unfccc.int>."
172,Indicator13-2-2,Total greenhouse gas emissions per year,"Definition, rationale and concepts:The ultimate objective of the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) is to achieve the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Estimating the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals is an important element of the efforts to achieve this objective.In accordance with Articles 4 and 12 of the Climate Change Convention and the relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties, countries that are Parties to the Convention submit national GHG inventories to the Climate Change secretariat. These submissions are made in accordance with the reporting requirements adopted under the Convention, such as the revised “Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual greenhouse gas inventories” (decision 24/CP.19) for Annex I Parties and “Guidelines for the preparation of national communications for non-Annex I Parties” (decision 17/CP.8). The inventory data are provided in the annual GHG inventory submissions by Annex I Parties and in the national communications and biennial update reports by non-Annex I Parties.The Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 marks the latest step in the evolution of the UN climate change regime and builds on the work undertaken under the Convention. Its central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change."
173,Indicator13-3-1,Extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment,"Definition:Indicator 4.7.1/12.8.1/13.3.1 measures the extent to which countries mainstream Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in their education systems. This is an indicator of characteristics of different aspects of education systems:  education policies, curricula, teacher training and student assessment as reported by government officials, ideally following consultation with other government ministries, national human rights institutes, the education sector and civil society organizations. It measures what governments intend and not what is implemented in practice in schools and classrooms. For each of the four components of the indicator (policies, curricula, teacher education, and student assessment), a number of criteria are measured, which are then combined to give a single score between zero and one for each component. (See methodology section for full details).The indicator and its methodology have been reviewed and endorsed by UNESCO’s Technical Cooperation Group on the Indicators for SDG 4-Education 2030 (TCG), which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the thematic indicator framework for the follow-up and review of SDG 4. The TCG also has an interest in education-related indicators in other SDGs, including global indicators 4.7.1 and 12.8.1. The TCG is composed of 28 regionally representative experts from UNESCO Member States (nominated by the respective geographic groups of UNESCO), as well as international and regional partners and civil society. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics acts as the Secretariat.Concepts:Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) nurture respect for all, build a sense of belonging to a common humanity, foster responsibility for a shared planet, and help learners become responsible and active global citizens and proactive contributors to a more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world. They aim to empower learners of all ages to face and resolve local and global challenges and to take informed decisions and actions for environmental integrity, economic viability and a just society for present and future generations, while respecting cultural diversity."
174,Indicator13-a-1,Amounts provided and mobilized in United States dollars per year in relation to the continued existing collective mobilization goal of the $100 billion commitment through to 2025,"Definition:Under the UNFCCC process, the COP requested the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) to prepare a Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows (BA) (decision 2/CP.17 paragraph 121(f)), drawing on the available sources of information, and including information on the geographical and thematic balance of flows. There is no agreed definition under the UNFCCC on what should count toward assessing progress toward the $100 billion commitment. Data from the UNFCCC secretariat refers to climate-specific financial support to developing country Parties, reported by Annex I Parties in their Biennial Reports. Only Annex II Parties are obligated to report on financial support provided and other Annex I Parties also voluntarily provide this information. Consequently, this data should not be interpreted as an indicator in relation to the achievement of the collective mobilization goal of $100 billion commitment. One of the functions of the SCF is to assist the COP with respect to the measurement, reporting and verification of the support provided to developing country Parties through activities such as the preparation of the Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows (BA). Subsequently, the COP requested SCF to consider: Relevant work by other bodies and entities on the MRV of support and the tracking of climate finance
(decision 1/CP.18 paragraph 71);Ways of strengthening methodologies for reporting climate finance (decision 5/CP.18 paragraph 11);Ongoing technical work on operational definitions of climate finance, including private finance mobilized by public interventions, to assess how adaptation and mitigation needs can most effectively be met by climate finance (decision 3/CP.19, paragraph 11).The SBSTA. by decision 18/CMA.1, paragraph 12a, was requested to develop the common tabular formats for the electronic reporting of the information referred to in chapters V and VI of the modalities, procedures and guidelines of enhanced framework, taking into account the existing the existing common tabular formats and common reporting formats."

176,Indicator14-1-1,(a) Index of coastal eutrophication; and (b) plastic debris density,"Definition: The indicator 14.1.1 includes two sub-indicators:14.1.1a Index of coastal eutrophication (ICEP), and 14.1.1b Plastic debris density. The indicator 14.1.1a “Index of coastal eutrophication” (ICEP) is based on loads and ratios of nitrogen, phosphorous and silica delivered by rivers to coastal waters (Garnier et al. 2010) which contribute to the ICEP. This indicator assumes that excess nitrogen or phosphorus relative to silica will result in increased growth of potentially harmful algae (ICEP>0).The indicator 14.1.1b “Plastic debris density"" includes potential measurement of plastics washed onto beaches or shorelines, floating on the water or in the water column, deposited on the seafloor/seabed, as well as ingested by biota; however, it is also important to note the importance of monitoring information on waste management and the sources of plastic pollution for understanding plastic pollution.Across the 14.1.1a and 14.1.1b, two mandatory levels are proposed: Level 1: Global Data Products (globally available data from earth observations and modelling), Level 2: National Data, which are collected from countries (through the relevant Regional Seas Programme for countries that are member of a Regional Seas Programme, or directly by UNEP).The tables 1 and 2 demonstrate the proposed parameters for sub-indicators 14.1.1a and 14.1.1b.Table 1: Monitoring parameters for eutrophication to track progress against SDG Indicator 14.1.1a.Table 2: Monitoring parameters for marine plastic litter to track progress against SDG Indicator 14.1.1b.Concepts:One of the largest pressures on coastal environments is eutrophication, resulting primarily from land-based nutrient input from agricultural runoff and domestic wastewater discharge. Coastal eutrophication can lead to serious damage to marine ecosystems, vital sea habitats, and can cause the spread of harmful algal blooms. SDG Indicator 14.1.1a aims to measure the contribution to coastal eutrophication from countries and the state of coastal eutrophication.Eutrophication is an excess nutrient loading into coastal environments from anthropogenic sources, resulting in excessive growth of plants, algae and phytoplankton. The basis for these loads is collected from land-based assessments of land use including fertilizer use, population density, socioeconomic factors and other contributors to nutrient pollution runoff. Given the land-based nature of the indicator, it provides a modelled number indicating the risk of coastal eutrophication at a specific river mouth.One more important characteristic is Chlorophyll-a deviation. Chlorophyll-a concentrations for this indicator are obtained from the global ocean, 4 km spatial resolution per pixel monthly mean product of the OC-CCI project product for each pixel within the country’s territorial sea and exclusive economic zone.Territorial sea is a belt of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles from the baseline of a coastal state, as outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea. The EEZ shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, as outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Based on the existing internationally agreed Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) guidelines and the existing national data collections, it is recommended that the SDG reporting includes sub-indicators related to beach litter, floating plastic and plastic in the sea column, plastic on the sea floor and additional option indicators.Plastic litter is most obvious on shorelines, where litter accumulates due to current, wave and wind action, river outflows and by direct littering at the coast. However, plastic litter occurs on the ocean surface, suspended in the water column, on the seabed and in association with biota, due to entanglement or ingestion (GESAMP, 2019).Marine litter - any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material which is lost or discarded and ends up in the marine and coastal environment.The full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled “Understanding the State of the Ocean: A Global Manual on Measuring SDG 14.1.1, SDG 14.2.1 and SDG 14.5.1” (UNEP, 2021). "
177,Indicator14-2-1,Number of countries using ecosystem-based approaches to managing marine areas,"Definition: Concepts:Regional Seas Coordinated Indicator 22 ‘Integrated Coastal Zone Management’ (ICZM) is proposed as the primary indicator. For countries with Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) in place, these plans can be helpful to assess ICZM. For other countries, it is important to identify ways to measure existing plans and to build capacity for integrated planning. An Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) plan covers the entire coastal zone. Marine and terrestrial areas are managed together. Plans are developed through coordination across different marine and terrestrial institutions and agencies.Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is focused on the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). It integrates the needs and policies of multiple marine sectors into one coherent planning framework.The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea. The EEZ shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, as outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Territorial sea is a belt of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles from the baseline of a coastal state, as outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.The full methodology for this indicator is available in the document entitled “Understanding the State of the Ocean: A Global Manual on Measuring SDG 14.1.1, SDG 14.2.1 and SDG 14.5.1” (UNEP, 2021)."
178,Indicator14-3-1,Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations,"Definitions:Ocean acidification is the decrease of seawater pH over an extended period, typically of decades or longer, which is caused primarily by the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This indicator is based on observations that constrain the ocean carbon system and which are required to describe the variability in ocean acidity. The carbon system in this context mainly refers to the four measurable parameters: pH (the concentration of hydrogen ions on a logarithmic scale), DIC (CT; total dissolved inorganic carbon), pCO2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure), and TA (AT, total alkalinity). Average, as used here, is the equally weighed annual mean. An agreed suite of representative sampling stations are sites that have a measurement frequency that is adequate for describing variability and trends in carbonate chemistry in order to deliver critical information on the exposure of and impacts on marine systems to ocean acidification, and which provide data of sufficient quality and with comprehensive metadata information to enable integration with data from other sites in the country. Concepts:Ocean acidification is caused by an increase in the amount of dissolved atmospheric CO2 in the seawater. The average marine acidity is expressed as pH, the concentration of hydrogen ions on a logarithmic scale. In order to be able to constrain the carbonate chemistry of seawater, it is necessary to measure at least two of the four parameters, i.e. pH, pCO2, DIC (CT), and TA (AT). pH (the concentration of hydrogen ions on a logarithmic scale, expressed on total scale), DIC (total dissolved inorganic carbon, in μmol kg-1), pCO2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure, in ppt or μatm), and TA (AT, total alkalinity, in μmol kg-1)."
179,Indicator14-4-1,Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels,"Definition:The indicator, ""Proportion of marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels"", measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries by the abundance of the exploited fish stocks with respect to MSY levels.For each level of reporting (National, Regional, Global) the indicator is calculated as the ratio between the number of exploited fish stocks classified as ""within biologically sustainable levels"" and the total number of stocks in the reference list that were classified with a determined status (within/not within ""biologically sustainable levels"").where Ps is the percentage of stocks classified as ""within biologically sustainable levels"" for the reference list of stocks. Ns is the number of stocks in the reference list classified as ""within biologically sustainable levels"", Nu is the number of stocks in the reference list classified as ""outside biologically sustainable levels"" and N = Ns + Nu is the total number of stocks in the reference list that have been classified as within or outside ""biologically sustainable levels"".Classifying individual stocks as within/outside ""biologically sustainable levels"":In order to keep consistency with the 14.4 target (""at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics"" and other earlier international agreements, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a fish stock is classified as ""within biologically sustainable levels"" if its abundance is estimated (considering uncertainty) to be equal to or greater than the level that can produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is classified as ""outside biologically sustainable levels"".A wide array of methods and approaches (including documented expert opinion) is used to classify stock status relative to the abundance producing MSY. This varies among countries, regions and stocks. Nevertheless, the reliability of the classification is assessed by FAO as part of the process of producing the index.Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is commonly defined as the greatest average amount of catch that can be harvested in the long-term from a stock under constant and current environmental conditions (e.g., habitat, water conditions, species composition and interactions, and anything that could affect birth, growth, or death rates of the stock), without affecting the long-term productivity of the stock. A stock can produce MSY if its abundance is above a certain level, usually around 50% of its unexploited abundance (but actual value can vary around that level, depending on the biological characteristics of the stock).  See more at https://www.fao.org/faoterm/en/?defaultCollId=21MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)). For more on Reference Points in Fish Stock Assessment, see Caddy and Mahon (1995), Cadima (2003) or Haddon (2011).BMSY: Biomass corresponding to Maximum Sustainable Yield from a production model or from an age-based analysis using a stock recruitment model. Often used as a biological reference point in fisheries management, it is the calculated long-term average biomass value expected if fishing at FMSY.A population is:  “A group of individuals of the same species living in the same area at the same time and sharing a common gene pool, with little or no immigration or emigration.”A biological stock is:  “A subpopulation of a species inhabiting a particular geographic area, having  similar biological characteristics  (e.g. growth, reproduction, mortality) and negligible genetic mixing with other adjacent subpopulations  of the same species."" (FAO, 2004-2021).The reference list of Stocks: it is not possible to classify the sustainability of exploitation for all the exploited stocks from a country, region or the world. Therefore, the indicator must be calculated based on a subset of these stocks. The list of the stocks that are classified for status and used to calculate the indicators is called the ""reference list of Stocks"".The reference list of Stocks is built differently for the Regional/Global and the National levels.  The process of building the reference list of Stocks for regional and global level are described in FAO (2011). At National level, countries are requested to define a list of stocks, based on an agreed set of criteria (Appendix 1). National and shared stocks can be included, but not straddling stocks (stocks that are distributed both in national EEZ and Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction).At this moment, there is not a direct correspondence between the national level reference lists (that are defined by each country) and the regional and global Reference lists (that are defined by FAO).FAO is working on an update of its methodology at global/regional level (FAO, 2024) which also addresses needs for convergence with the national level. Full results of the application of this updated methodology are planned to be published in 2026.The detailed description of all necessary concepts can be found in the e-learning course (FAO 2019-2021)."
180,Indicator14-5-1,Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas,"Definition:The indicator Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas shows trends over time in the mean percentage of each important site for marine biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs).Concepts:Protected areas, as defined by the IUCN (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. "
181,Indicator14-6-1,"Degree of implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing","Definition:Progress by countries in the degree of implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.Concepts:The definitions and concepts associated with the indicator and utilized in the methodology are defined in the FAO term portal: http://www.fao.org/faoterm/collection/fisheries/en/ This indicator is based on a country’s implementation of the different international instruments that combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU fishing). IUU fishing undermines national and regional efforts to conserve and manage fish stocks and, as a consequence, inhibits progress towards achieving the goals of long-term sustainability and responsibility as set forth in, inter alia, Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 and the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Moreover, IUU fishing greatly disadvantages and discriminates against those fishers that act responsibly, honestly and in accordance with the terms of their fishing authorizations. This is a compelling reason why IUU fishing must be dealt with expeditiously and in a transparent manner. If IUU fishing is not curbed, and if IUU fishers target vulnerable stocks that are subject to strict management controls or moratoria, efforts to rebuild those stocks to healthy levels will not be achieved. To efficiently curb IUU fishing a number of different international instruments have been developed over the years that focus on the implementation of the different responsibilities of States. The instruments covered by this indicator and their role in combatting IUU fishing are as follows:•	The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)This instrument is the basis upon which all the subsequent instruments are built upon. UNCLOS defines the rights and responsibilities of nations with respect to their use of the world's oceans, establishing guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine natural resources. It is a binding instrument, although its principles may also be applied by countries who are not party to it.•	The Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UN Fish Stocks Agreement)The UN Fish Stocks Agreement entered into force on 11 December 2001, and is the most comprehensive of the binding international instruments in defining the role of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and elaborating measures that could be taken in relation to IUU fishing activities. Although the UN Fish Stocks Agreement applies primarily to the highly migratory and straddling fish stocks on the high seas, its broad acceptance and application is evidenced by the reinforcement of other international instruments, implementation at the regional level, and to some extent by State practice within areas of national jurisdiction.•	The International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU)The objective of the IPOA is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing by providing all States with comprehensive, effective and transparent measures by which to act, including through appropriate regional fisheries management organizations established in accordance with international law. This instrument covers all the aspects of a State’s responsibilities including, flag State responsibilities, coastal State measures, port State measures, internationally agreed market-related measures, research and regional fisheries management organizations.•	The 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (PSMA)The FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing entered into force on the 5th of June 2016. The main purpose of the Agreement is to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through the implementation of robust port State measures. The Agreement envisages that parties, in their capacities as port States, will apply the Agreement in an effective manner to foreign vessels when seeking entry to ports or while they are in port. The application of the measures set out in the Agreement will, inter alia, contribute to harmonized port State measures, enhanced regional and international cooperation and block the flow of IUU-caught fish into national and international markets.•	The FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance (VG-FSP)The FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance spell out a range of actions that countries can take to ensure that vessels registered under their flags do not conduct IUU fishing, including monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) activities, such as vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and observers. They promote information exchange and cooperation among countries so that flag states are in a position to refuse to register vessels that are ""flag-hopping"" by attempting to register with another flag state or to refuse vessels that have been reported for IUU fishing. The Guidelines also include recommendations on how countries can encourage compliance and take action against non-compliance by vessels, as well as on how to enhance international cooperation to assist developing countries to fulfil their flag state responsibilities.•	The FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement)The 1993 FAO Compliance Agreement entered into force on the 24th of April 2003. Its main purpose is to encourage countries to take effective action, consistent with international law, and to deter the reflagging of vessels by their nationals as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management rules for fishing activities on the high seas. With respect to the role of RFBs, the preamble calls upon States which do not participate in global, regional or sub regional fishery organizations or arrangements to do so, with a view to achieving compliance with international conservation and management measures."
182,Indicator14-7-1,"Sustainable fisheries as a proportion of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries","Definitions:This indicator expresses the value added of sustainable marine capture fisheries as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).Concepts:The GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given period, which is equivalent to the sum of the value added (VA) from all sectors in an economy.The value added of marine capture fisheries measures the value of fish harvested from marine stocks, minus the value of goods and services that are used in the production process (such as raw materials and utilities). It includes activities that are normally integrated into the process of production and occur at sea, such as fishing vessels which process or preserve their catch on board. However, it does not include the processing or preserving of fish when it occurs in land-based facilities.A fish stock is a subset of a species (fish, crustacean, mollusc, etc.) or a population inhabiting a geographical area and participating in the same reproductive process.Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is the highest theoretical equilibrium yield that can be continuously taken (on average) from a stock under existing (average) environmental conditions without significantly affecting the reproduction process. A stock fished at (MSY) is referred to as biologically sustainable, as it may remain stable or grow while sustaining losses from fishing and natural sources of mortality.FAO Fishing Areas for Statistical Purposes are arbitrary areas to facilitate comparison of data, improving the possibilities of cooperation in statistical matters.The basic concepts associated with this indicator are part of the following international instruments and classification schemes:The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)This instrument is the basis upon which all the subsequent instruments are built. UNCLOS defines the rights and responsibilities of nations concerning their use of the world's oceans, establishing guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine natural resources. It is a binding instrument, although its principles may also be applied by countries who are not a party to it.The 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF)This instrument provides the necessary framework for national and international efforts to ensure sustainable exploitation of aquatic living resources in harmony with the environment by establishing principles and standards applicable to the conservation, management, and development of all fisheries.The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries relies on the concept of MSY when setting general principles and standards for fisheries management.  Article 7.2.1 details how management measures should be “based on the best scientific evidence available” and “designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, including the special requirements of developing countries.”United Nation’s International Standard Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) All components of marine capture fisheries are clearly defined within section A 0311 ISIC revision"
183,Indicator14-a-1,Proportion of total research budget allocated to research in the field of marine technology,"Definition:Definitions and mechanisms used in the development of the SDG indicator 14.a.1 are based on the IOC Criteria and Guidelines on Transfer of Marine Technology – IOCCGTMT (originally published and endorsed by IOC Member States in 2005. These guidelines provide an internationally agreed definition of what is understood by the term marine technology and have been referenced in various UN General Assembly Resolutions and specifically in the formulation of SDG target 14.a. These are further explained in the Global Ocean Science Report (GOSR) referenced below.Marine technology as defined in the IOCCGTMT refers to instruments, equipment, vessels, processes and methodologies required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas. Toward this end, marine technology may include any of the following components:Information and data, in a user-friendly format, on marine sciences and related marine operations and services;Manuals, guidelines, criteria, standards, reference materials;Sampling and methodology equipment (e.g., for water, geological, biological, chemical samples);Observation facilities and equipment (e.g. remote sensing equipment, buoys, tide gauges, shipboard and other means of ocean observation);Equipment for in situ and laboratory observations, analysis and experimentation;Computer and computer software, including models and modelling techniques;Expertise, knowledge, skills, technical/scientific/legal know-how and analytical methods related to marine scientific research and observation.Indicator 14.a.1 shows the annual national research budget allocated by governments in the field of marine technology, relative to the overall national governmental research and development budget in general.Unit: percentage; raw data in national currency. The proportion can be calculated, and if needed, data can be converted by the international agency into USD.Concepts:The concepts used for the definition and calculation of the indicator 14.a.1 are based on similar concepts used in the UNESCO Science Report (2010, 2015).These reports present GERD data (gross domestic expenditure on research and experimental development) as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) and further provide the R&D (research and development) expenditure by sector of performance in % (Table S2 in the 2015 UNESCO Science Report). In addition, UIS publishes science field specific R&D, e.g. natural sciences (http://data.uis.unesco.org/).The definitions and classifications used to collect R&D data are based on the ‘Frascati Manual: Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys on Research and Experimental Development’ (OECD, 2002)."

186,Indicator15-1-1,Forest area as a proportion of total land area,"Definition:Forest area as a proportion of total land areaConcepts:To provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to provide a definition of its two components:“Forest” and “Land Area”. According to the FAO, Forest is defined as: “land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use”. More specifically:Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses.

188,Indicator15-2-1,Progress towards sustainable forest management,"Definition: “Sustainable forest management” (SFM) is a central concept for Goal 15 and target 15.1 as well as for target 15.2. It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: [a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations” (Resolution A/RES/62/98) The indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of sustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators focused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of forests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-indicator provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards. The sub-indicators are: Annual forest area change rate Above-ground biomass in forest Proportion of forest area within legally established protected areas Proportion of forest area under a long-term management plan Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme A dashboard is used to assess progress related to the five sub-indicators. The adoption of the dashboard approach aims at ensuring consideration of all dimensions of sustainable forest management and provides for clear view of areas where progress has been achieved. Concepts: See Annex 1 with Terms and Definitions. "
189,Indicator15-3-1,Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area,"Definitions:Land degradation is defined as the reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of rain fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest and woodlands resulting from a combination of pressures, including land use and management practices. This definition was adopted by and is used by the 196 countries that are Party to the UNCCD. (see also Figure 1)Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is defined as a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remain stable or increase within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems (decision 3/COP12).Total land area is the total surface area of a country excluding the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes.SDG indicator 15.3.1 is a binary - degraded/not degraded - quantification based on the analysis of available data for three sub-indicators to be validated and reported by national authorities. The sub-indicators (Trends in Land Cover, Land Productivity and Carbon Stocks) were adopted by the UNCCD’s governing body in 2013 as part of its monitoring and evaluation approach. The method of computation for this indicator follows the “One Out, All Out” statistical principle and is based on the baseline assessment and evaluation of change in the sub-indicators to determine the extent of land that is degraded over total land area.The One Out, All Out (1OAO) principle is applied taking into account changes in the sub-indicators which are depicted as (i) positive or improving, (ii) negative or declining, or (iii) stable or unchanging. If one of the sub-indicators is negative (or stable when degraded in the baseline or previous monitoring year) for a particular land unit, then it would be considered as degraded subject to validation by national authorities.Concepts:The assessment and quantification of land degradation is generally regarded as context-specific, making it difficult for a single indicator to fully capture the state or condition of the land. While necessary but not sufficient, the sub-indicators address changes in different yet highly relevant ways: for example, land cover or productivity trends can capture relatively fast changes while changes in carbon stocks reflect slower changes that suggest a trajectory or proximity to thresholds. As proxies to monitor the key factors and driving variables that reflect the capacity to deliver land-based ecosystem services, the sub-indicators are globally agreed upon in definition and methodology of calculation, and deemed both technically and economically feasible for systematic observation under both the Global Climate Observation System (GCOS) and the integrated measurement framework of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). The ultimate determination of the extent of degraded land made by national authorities should be contextualized with other indicators, data and ground-based information.An operational definition of land degradation along with a description of the linkages among the sub-indicators is given in Figure 1. Figure 1: Operational definition of land degradation and linkage with the sub-indicators.Land cover refers to the observed physical cover of the Earth’s surface which describes the distribution of vegetation types, water bodies and human-made infrastructure. It also reflects the use of land resources (i.e., soil, water and biodiversity) for agriculture, forestry, human settlements and other purposes. This sub-indicator serves two functions for SDG indicator 15.3.1: (1) changes in land cover may point to land degradation when there is a loss of ecosystem services that are considered desirable in a local or national context; and (2) a land cover classification system can be used to disaggregate the other two sub-indicators, thus increasing the indicator’s policy relevance. This sub-indicator is also expected to be used for reporting on SDG indicators 6.6.1, 11.3.1 and 15.1.1.Land productivity refers to the total above-ground net primary production (NPP) defined as the energy fixed by plants minus their respiration which translates into the rate of biomass accumulation that delivers a suite of ecosystem services. This sub-indicator points to changes in the health and productive capacity of the land and reflects the net effects of changes in ecosystem functioning on plant and biomass growth, where declining trends are often a defining characteristic of land degradation.
Carbon stock is the quantity of carbon in a “pool”: a reservoir which has the capacity to accumulate or release carbon and is comprised of above- and below-ground biomass, dead organic matter, and soil organic carbon. In UNCCD decision 22/COP.11, soil organic carbon (SOC) stock was adopted as the metric to be used with the understanding that this metric will be replaced by total terrestrial system carbon stocks, once operational. SOC is an indicator of overall soil quality associated with nutrient cycling and its aggregate stability and structure with direct implications for water infiltration, soil biodiversity, vulnerability to erosion, and ultimately the productivity of vegetation, and in agricultural contexts, yields. SOC stocks reflect the balance between organic matter gains, dependent on plant productivity and management practices, and losses due to decomposition through the action of soil organisms and physical export through leaching and erosion."
190,Indicator15-4-1,Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity,"Definition:The indicator Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for mountain biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs).Concepts:Protected areas, as defined by the IUCN (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. "
191,Indicator15-4-2,(a) Mountain Green Cover Index and (b) proportion of degraded mountain land,"Definitions:The indicator is composed of two sub-indicators to monitor progress towards the conservation of mountain ecosystems:Sub-indicator 15.4.2a, Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI), is designed to measure the extent and changes of green cover - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, cropland, etc. – in mountain areas. MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain area of a given country and for given reporting year. The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of green cover and thus assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.Sub-indicator 15.4.2b, Proportion of degraded mountain land, is designed to monitor the extent of degraded mountain land as a result of land cover change in a given country and for given reporting year. Similarly to sub-indicator ‘’trends in land cover” under SDG Indicator 15.3.1 (Sims et al. 2021), mountain ecosystem degradation and recovery is assessed based on the definition of land cover type transitions that indicate improving, stable or degrading conservation status. The definition of degradation adopted for the computation of this indicator is the one established Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).Concepts:Mountain area is defined according to the UNEP-WCMC (2002) method. It defines total global mountain area as the sum of seven classes (commonly known as ‘Kapos mountain classes’), based on elevation, slope and local elevation ranges (Table 1).Table 1. Global mountain classes as defined by UNEP-WCMC (2002)Prior to the methodological refinement of this indicator approved by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDG) in June 2022, the UNEP-WCMC classification was used to disaggregate the indicator by Kapos mountain classes. This is no longer the case, with Kapos mountain classes having been replaced by a bioclimatic belts (see section 2.c below).Land cover refers to the observed physical cover of the Earth’s surface. It includes vegetation and man-made features as well as bare rock, bare soil and inland water surfaces (FAO-GTOS, 2009). The primary units for characterizing land cover are categories (e.g. Forest or Open Water). These categories must be defined following a standardized land cover classification in order to identify land cover changes consistently over time. Several global standards of land cover classifications have been developed by international initiatives for this purpose. For the purposes of standardization and harmonization when reporting on SDG Indicator 15.4.2, this indicator has adapted the land cover classification established by the United Nations Statistical Commission’s System of Environmental and Economic Accounting (UN-SEEA) (UN Statistical Division, 2014) by selecting the most relevant SEEA classes for mountain ecosystems and aggregating all croplands classes (Table 2).Table 2. Left: Land cover classification established by the UN-SEEA (Source: UN Statistical Division, 2014). Right: Adapted land cover classification for the computation and aggregate reporting on SDG Indicator 15.4.2.Land cover serves different functions for SDG Indicator 15.4.2:In sub-indicator 15.4.2a, land cover is used to categorize land into green and non-green cover areas. As showed in Table 3, green cover includes areas covered by both natural vegetation and vegetation resulting from anthropic activity. Non-green areas include non-vegetated areas such as bare land, water, permanent ice/snow, urban areas and sparsely vegetated areas. In addition, land cover is used to disaggregate the indicator into the 10 land cover classes included in Table 2, thus increasing the indicator’s policy relevance.Table 3. Classification of SEEA land cover classes into green and non-green cover.In sub-indicator 15.4.2b, land cover is used to identify areas where changes in the type of land cover (land cover transitions) may indicate a decline or loss of biodiversity, mountain ecosystem functions or services that are considered desirable in a local or national context. A transition that indicates a decline or loss of biodiversity and mountain ecosystem services of the land is considered degradation. The definition of land cover transitions is documented in a transition matrix that specifies the land cover changes occurring in a given land unit (pixel) as being either degradation, improvement or neutral transitions."
192,Indicator15-5-1,Red List Index,"Definition:The Red List Index measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on genuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (www.iucnredlist.org) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1.Concepts:Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time in the proportion of species threatened with extinction are largely driven by improvements in knowledge and changing taxonomy. The indicator excludes such changes to yield a more informative indicator than the simple proportion of threatened species. It therefore measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species over time, resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of individual species. It can be calculated for any representative set of species that have been assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice (Butchart et al. 2004, 2005, 2007). To calculate the Red List Index for individual countries and regions, each species contributing to the index is weighted by the proportion of its global range within the particular country or region. The resulting index therefore shows the aggregate extinction risk for species within the country or region relative to its potential contribution to global species extinction risk (within the taxonomic groups included)."
193,Indicator15-6-1,"Number of countries that have adopted legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits","DefinitionThe indicator is defined as the number of countries that have adopted legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits.  It refers to the efforts by countries to implement the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010) and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2001).The Nagoya Protocol covers genetic resources and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources, as well as the benefits arising from their utilization by setting out core obligations for its contracting Parties to take measures in relation to access, benefit-sharing and compliance.  The objectives of the International Treaty are the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of their use, in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity.   The Protocol provides greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, and therefore, encourages the advancement of research on genetic resources which could lead to new discoveries for the benefit of all. The Nagoya Protocol also creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and thereby enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being. In addition, Parties to the Protocol are to encourage users and providers to direct benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources towards the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components.The International Treaty has established the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing, which facilitates exchanges of plant genetic resources for purposes of agricultural research and breeding to contribute to sustainable agriculture and food security, by providing a transparent and reliable framework for the exchange of crop genetic resources. The Multilateral System is instrumental to achieving the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use. The Standard Material Transfer Agreement is a mandatory standard contract for parties wishing to provide and receive material under the Multilateral System.   "
194,Indicator15-7-1,Proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly trafficked,"Definition:The share of all trade in wildlife detected as being illegalConcepts:“All trade in wildlife” is the sum of the values of legal and illegal trade“Legal trade” is the sum of the value of all shipments made in compliance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), using valid CITES permits and certificates.“Illegal trade” is the sum of the value of all CITES/listed specimens seized."
195,Indicator15-8-1,Proportion of countries adopting relevant national legislation and adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien species,"Definition:This indicator aims to quantify trends in: Commitment by countries to relevant multinational agreements, specifically:(1) National adoption of invasive alien species relevant policy. Percentage of countries with (a) national legislation and policy relevant to invasive alien species. (b) targets and objectives within national strategies for preventing and controlling invasive alien species are aligned with Aichi Target 9.The translation of policy arrangements into action by countries to implement policy and actively prevent and control invasive alien species (IAS) and the resourcing of this action, specifically:(2) National allocation of resources towards the prevention or control of IAS.Concepts:An “Alien” species is described as one which has been introduced outside its natural distribution range because of intentional or accidental dispersion by human activity. An alien species which has become established in a natural or semi-natural ecosystem or habitat, is an agent of change, and threatens native biological diversity is known as an “Invasive alien species” (Convention on Biological Diversity 2016).The introduction of an alien species can be intentional or unintentional/accidental. Alien species have been introduced intentionally for forestry, ornamental purposes, for aquaculture/mariculture, hunting, fisheries etc. Examples of unintentional or accidental introductions include: alien species that have escaped from gardens, aquaculture containment facilities, forestry, horticulture; pets and aquarium species that are released in the wild; transport contaminants and stowaways including in ballast water or as hull fouling organisms, and seeds carried in soil, equipment, vehicles etc.Mechanisms of impact of invasive species include competition, predation, hybridisation, and disease transmission, parasitism, herbivory and trampling and rooting. The outcomes of these impacts lead to biodiversity loss, habitat degradation, and loss of ecosystem services.Comments and limitations:The adoption of legislation does not necessarily indicate the existence of regulations or policy to implement the legislation, nor how successful such implementation has been on the ground. There remains a need for further indicator development to make this link clearer. Legislation does not necessarily capture all efforts against invasive alien species that are happening at the national level.Allocation of resources to facilitate the implementation of IAS management action is difficult to measure, particularly in a way that is comparable across countries. Proxies used to measure allocation of resources included- allocation of a budget line to invasive species management activities (including prevention, rapid response, and active management); appointed staff to carry out any IAS related activities; active programmes/projects etc."

The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) is intended to define the current status of biodiversity, the threats leading to its degradation and the strategies and priority actions to ensure its conservation and sustainable use within the framework of the socio-economic development of the country.National ReportsIn accordance with Article 26 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Parties are obligated to provide information on measures taken towards the implementation of the Convention and its strategic plans, as reflected in the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP), as well as on the effectiveness of these measures. The format for the sixth national reports requested that Parties, among other things, provide an assessment of their progress towards their national targets and/or the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. These national reports are publicly available on the Convention’s Clearing-House Mechanism, which is constantly being improved to enhance usability by Parties and better contribute to assessment of the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.The system of environmental-economic accounting is presented by two international statistical standards: the System for Environmental-Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA-CF), adopted in 2012, and the System for Environmental-Economic Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA), adopted in 2021.SEEA-CF The System for Environmental-Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA-CF) is an international statistical standard for measuring the environment and its relationship with the economy. It integrates economic and environmental data to provide a more comprehensive and multipurpose view of the interrelationships between the economy and the environment and the stocks and changes in stocks of environmental assets, as they bring benefits to humanity.SEEA-EA The System for Environmental-Economic Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) is an integrated statistical framework for organizing biophysical data, measuring ecosystem services in physical and monetary terms, tracking changes in the condition and extent of ecosystem assets and linking this information to economic and other human activity. The SEEA-EA takes the perspective of ecosystems and considers how individual environmental assets interact as part of natural processes within a given spatial area.

200,Indicator16-1-1,"Number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, by sex and age","Definition:The indicator is defined as the total count of victims of intentional homicide divided by the total population, expressed per 100,000 population.Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); population refers to total resident population in a given country in a given year.Concepts:The International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) is the source of the definition of intentional homicide.Intentional homicide (ICCS 0101): Unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury.The statistical definition contains three elements that characterize the killing of a person as “intentional homicide”:1. The killing of a person by another person (objective element);2. The intent of the perpetrator to kill or seriously injure the victim (subjective element);3. The unlawfulness of the killing, which means that the law considers the perpetrator liable for the unlawful death (legal element).This definition states that, for statistical purposes, all killings corresponding to the three criteria above should be considered as intentional homicides, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislations or practices.In the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), deaths coded with ICD-10 codes X85-Y09 (injuries inflicted by another person with intent to injure or kill) and ICD-10 code Y87.1 (sequelae of assault), or ICD-11 codes PD50-PF2Z and PJ20-PJ2Z, generally correspond to the definition of intentional homicide discussed above."
201,Indicator16-1-2,"Conflict-related deaths per 100,000 population, by sex, age and cause","Definitions:This indicator is defined as the total count of conflict-related deaths divided by the total population, expressed per 100,000 population.‘Conflict’ is defined as ‘armed conflict’ in reference to a terminology enshrined in International Humanitarian Law (IHL), and applied to situations based on the assessment of the United Nations (UN) and other internationally mandated entities.  ‘Conflict-related deaths’ refers to direct and indirect deaths associated to armed conflict.  ‘Population’ refers to total resident population in a given situation of armed conflict included in the indicator, in a given year. Population data are derived from annual estimates produced by the UN Population Division.Concepts:‘Conflict’According to IHL, the branch of international law, which specifically focuses on armed conflicts, two types of armed conflicts exist: international armed conflicts (IAC) and non-international armed conflicts (NIAC). IAC exist whenever there is resort to armed force between two or more States. An IAC does not exist in cases in which use of force is the result of an error (e.g. involuntary incursion into foreign territory, wrongly identifying the target); and when the territorial State has given its consent to an intervention. NIAC are protracted armed confrontations occurring between governmental armed forces and the forces of one or more armed groups, or between such groups arising on the territory of a State. The armed confrontation must reach a “minimum level of intensity” and the parties involved in the conflict must show a “minimum of organisation”.  ‘Conflict-related deaths’Direct deaths are deaths where there are reasonable grounds to believe that they resulted directly from war operations and that the acts, decisions and/or purposes that caused these deaths were in furtherance of or under the guise of armed conflict. These deaths may have been caused by (i) the use of weapons or (ii) other means and methods.  Deaths caused by the use of weapons, include but are not limited to those inflicted by firearms, missiles, mines, and bladed weapons. It may also include deaths resulting from aerial attacks and bombardments (e.g. of military bases, cities and villages), crossfire, explosive remnants of war, targeted killings or assassinations, force protection incidents. Deaths caused by other means and methods may include deaths from torture or sexual and gender-based violence, intentional killing using starvation, depriving prisoners of access to health care or denying access to essential goods and services  (e.g. an ambulance stopped at a check point).Indirect deaths are deaths resulting from a loss of access to essential goods and services (e.g. economic slowdown, shortages of medicines or reduced farming capacity that result in lack of access to adequate food, water, sanitation, health care and safe conditions of work) that are caused or aggravated by the situation of armed conflict.By definition, these deaths should be separated from other violent deaths which are, in principle, not connected to the situation of armed conflict (e.g. intentional and non-intentional homicides, self-defence, self-inflicted), but are still relevant to the implementation and measurement of SDG target 16.1. The International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) provides definitional elements and classification of violent deaths both related and not related to armed conflict.  The ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/armed conflict and killings that amount to war crimes.‘Cause’ refers to the weapons, means and methods that caused the conflict-related deaths.  The categories for the disaggregation of the ‘cause of death’ for direct deaths build on the WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), ICCS, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) overview of weapons regulated by IHL, UN practice and OHCHR casualty recording.

202,Indicator16-1-3,"Proportion of population subjected to (a) physical violence, (b) psychological violence and (c) sexual violence in the previous 12 months","Definition:The total number of persons who have been victim of (a) physical, (b) psychological and (c) sexual violence in the previous 12 months, as a share of the total population.Three separate indicators should be computed, one for each type of violence.Concepts:This indicator measures the prevalence of victimization from (a) physical, (b) psychological and (c) sexual violence respectively.(a) Physical violence: This concept largely corresponds to physical assault and robbery.Assault is defined in the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) as: the intentional or reckless application of physical force inflicted upon the body of a person. This includes the intentional or reckless application of serious physical force resulting in serious bodily injury, and the intentional or reckless application of minor physical force resulting in no injury or minor bodily injury. According to the ICCS, these are defined as:Serious bodily injury, at minimum, includes gunshot or bullet wounds; knife or stab wounds; severed limbs; broken bones or teeth knocked out; internal injuries; being knocked unconscious; and other severe or critical injuries.Serious physical force, at minimum, includes being shot; stabbed or cut; hit by an object; hit by a thrown object; poisoning and other applications of force with the potential to cause serious bodily injury.Minor bodily injury, at minimum, includes bruises, cuts, scratches, chipped teeth, swelling, black eye and other minor injuries.Minor physical force, at minimum, includes hitting, slapping, pushing, tripping, knocking down and other applications of force with the potential to cause minor bodily injury.In addition to acts of assault, acts amounting to serious physical threats are also included in the definition of physical violence. As defined in the ICCS, serious physical threats refer to threats with the intention to cause death or serious bodily injury.Furthermore, physical violence also covers acts of robbery, defined in the ICCS as unlawfully taking or obtaining property with the use of force or threat of force against a person with intent to permanently or temporarily withhold it from a person or organization.Physical violence only counts as such when it is non-consensual, for example, acts of physical violence (punching, kicking, etc.) experienced while exercising a regulated combat sport or combat training will not count towards victimization prevalence.In the absence of suitable data on physical violence, it is possible to use data on physical assault or robbery, given they are both component of physical violence. Psychological violence: There is no consensus at the international level on the precise definition of psychological violence. Psychological violence may be defined as any intentional and reckless act that causes psychological distress to an individual. Psychological violence can take the form of, for example, coercion, defamation, humiliation, intimidation, credible threats of violence, excessive verbal attacks or bullying, or harassment. Often, psychological violence is a pattern of behaviours, but it may be a distinct incident as well. Psychological violence is often experienced in domestic contexts. The internationally standardized and tested SDG 16 survey questionnaire  provides a methodology and a core set of questions to measure psychological violence (see Section 4.c. Method of computation). Sexual violence: As defined in the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), sexual violence includes unwanted sexual acts or attempts to obtain a sexual act without valid consent or with consent as a result of intimidation, force, fraud, coercion, threat, deception, use of drugs or alcohol, or abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability. This includes rape and other forms of sexual assault, excluding non-physical sexual assault (e.g. sexual harassment). Sexual violence may be perpetrated by casual partners, by acquaintances or by strangers, but such acts also occur in established or even in formalized intimate partnerships, including in marriages. Sexual violence most often, but not exclusively, targets women. Sexual violence may also take place in same-sex contexts.More details on the set of behaviours to be used to measure physical, psychological and sexual violence are provided in Section 4.c. Method of computation."
203,Indicator16-1-4,Proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live after dark,"Definition:This indicator refers to the proportion of the adult population who feel safe walking alone in their neighbourhood after dark.Concepts:“Neighbourhood” – the indicator aims to capture fear of crime in the context of people’s everyday lives. It does so by limiting the area in question to the “neighbourhood” or “area they live in”. Various other formulations of local neighbourhood may be appropriate depending on cultural, physical and language context. Providing a universally applicable definition of neighborhood is challenging, as one’s neighbourhood is a subjective concept that will mean different things to different people. “After dark”- the indicator should specifically capture respondent’s feelings and perceptions when walking alone after dark. The specific reference to darkness is important because according to research, darkness is one of the factors individuals perceive as important when assessing whether a situation is dangerous. While the specific reference to “after dark” is the preferrable wording and widely used in crime victimisation surveys, a suitable alternative wording is “at night”. Specifying an exact time of the day (e.g. 6pm), however, is not advisable as darkness (not time of day per se) is the factor that affects individuals perception of safety, and cross-national as well as seasonal variation in the onset of darkness makes it problematic to establish a universally suitable threshold to define nighttime."
204,Indicator16-2-1,Proportion of children aged 1–17 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month,"Definition:Proportion of children aged 1-17 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month is currently being measured by the Proportion of children aged 1-14 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month.Concepts:In Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), psychological aggression refers to the action of shouting, yelling or screaming at a child, as well as calling a child offensive names, such as ‘dumb’ or ‘lazy’. Physical (or corporal) punishment is an action intended to cause physical pain or discomfort, but not injuries. Physical punishment is defined as shaking the child, hitting or slapping him/her on the hand/arm/leg, hitting him/her on the bottom or elsewhere on the body with a hard object, spanking or hitting him/her on the bottom with a bare hand, hitting or slapping him/her on the face, head or ears, and beating him/her over and over as hard as possible.'Past month' typically refers to the 30 days prior to the interview/data collection (in other words, has the child experienced violent discipline at any point in the 30 days prior to data collection). 'Caregiver' refers to any adult household member with caregiving responsibilities for the child (not just the primary caregiver or the respondent to the questionnaire)."
205,Indicator16-2-2,"Number of victims of human trafficking per 100,000 population, by sex, age and form of exploitation","Definition:The indicator is defined as the ratio between the total number of victims of trafficking in persons in a country and the population resident in that country, expressed per 100,000 population.According to Article 3, paragraph (a) of the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol, trafficking in persons is defined as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs”.Article 3, (b) states “the consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been used”;Article 3, (c) states “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered trafficking in persons even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a);""Concepts:According to the definition given in the Trafficking in Persons Protocol, trafficking in persons has three constituent elements; The Act (Recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons), the Means(Threat or use of force, coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability, or giving payments or benefits to a person in control over another person) and the Purpose (at minimum exploiting the prostitution of others, sexual exploitation, forced labour, slavery or similar practices and the removal of organs).The definition implies that the exploitation does not need to be in place, as the intention by traffickers to exploit the victim is sufficient to define a trafficking offence. Furthermore, the list of exploitative forms is not limited, which means that other forms of exploitation may emerge and they could be considered to represent additional forms of trafficking offences."
206,Indicator16-2-3,Proportion of young women and men aged 18–29 years who experienced sexual violence by age 18,"Definition:Proportion of young women and men aged 18-29 years who experienced sexual violence by age 18Concepts:Definition from General Comment No. 13 on the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC):Sexual violence comprises any sexual activities imposed by an adult on a child against which the child is entitled to protection by criminal law. This includes: (a) The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful or psychologically harmful sexual activity; (b) The use of children in commercial sexual exploitation; (c) The use of children in audio or visual images of child sexual abuse; and (d) Child prostitution, sexual slavery, sexual exploitation in travel and tourism, trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation (within and between countries), sale of children for sexual purposes and forced marriage. Sexual activities are also considered as abuse when committed against a child by another child if the offender is significantly older than the victim or uses power, threat or other means of pressure. Consensual sexual activities between children are not considered as sexual abuse if the children are older than the age limit defined by the State Party."
207,Indicator16-3-1,Proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms,"Definition:Number of victims of violent crime in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms, as a percentage of all victims of violence in the previous 12 months.Reporting rates to be computed separately for physical, sexual and psychological violence. For each of the indicators of violence (physical, psychological and sexual), countries should calculate the share of victims who reported their victimization. Those reporting rates are published separately. Concepts:Competent authorities include police, prosecutors or other authorities with competencies to investigate relevant crimes, while “other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms” may include a variety of institutions with a role in the informal justice or dispute resolution process (i.e. tribal or religious leaders, village elders, community leaders), provided their role is officially recognized by state authorities. The operationalization of these concepts is to be provided by national implementation teams by adding appropriate response categories for the authorities and mechanisms to which victims may report the violence they have experienced. Physical violence: This concept corresponds to physical assault and robbery.Assault is defined in the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) as: the intentional or reckless application of physical force inflicted upon the body of a person.  This includes the intentional or reckless application of serious physical force resulting in serious bodily injury, and the intentional or reckless application of minor physical force resulting in no injury or minor bodily injury. According to the ICCS, these are defined as:Serious bodily injury, at minimum, includes gunshot or bullet wounds; knife or stab wounds; severed limbs; broken bones or teeth knocked out; internal injuries; being knocked unconscious; and other severe or critical injuries.Serious physical force, at minimum, includes being shot; stabbed or cut; hit by an object; hit by a thrown object; poisoning and other applications of force with the potential to cause serious bodily injury.Minor bodily injury, at minimum, includes bruises, cuts, scratches, chipped teeth, swelling, black eye and other minor injuries.Minor physical force, at minimum, includes hitting, slapping, pushing, tripping, knocking down and other applications of force with the potential to cause minor bodily injury.In addition to acts of assault, acts amounting to serious physical threats are also included in the definition of physical violence. As defined in the ICCS, serious physical threats refer to threats with the intention to cause death or serious bodily injury.Furthermore, physical violence also covers acts of robbery, defined in the ICCS as unlawfully taking or obtaining property with the use of force or threat of force against a person with intent to permanently or temporarily withhold it from a person or organization.Physical violence only counts as such when it is non-consensual, for example, acts of physical violence (punching, kicking, etc.) experienced while exercising a regulated combat sport or combat training will not count towards victimization prevalence.In the absence of suitable data on physical violence, it is possible to use data on physical assault or robbery , given they are both component of physical violence.

208,Indicator16-3-2,Unsentenced detainees as a proportion of overall prison population,"Definition:The total number of persons held in detention who have not yet been sentenced, as a percentage of the total number of persons held in detention, on a specified date.Concepts:‘Persons held in detention‘ refers to persons held in Prisons, Penal Institutions or Correctional Institutions on a specified day and should exclude non-criminal prisoners held for administrative purposes, for example, persons held pending investigation into their immigration status or foreign citizens without a legal right to stay. Also, people under house arrest, persons under other forms of sanctions or supervision, such as electronic surveillance or community-based surveillance should be excluded from the prison population (persons held in prison).‘Sentenced’ refers persons held in prisons, penal institutions or correctional institutions after a first instance decision or a final decision on their case has been made by a competent authority. This includes sentenced prisoners with a final decision and persons held who are awaiting the outcome of an appeal in respect of verdict or sentence or who are within the statutory limits for appealing . Persons held who have received a custodial sentence for one crime but are still under trial and unsentenced for another crime should be counted as sentenced persons held.  Furthermore, for the purpose of international comparability, persons held who have been convicted of a crime (in a first instance decision) but who have not yet received a sentence should also be treated as ‘sentenced’, even if national definitions of sentenced detainees are narrower.  ’.‘Unsentenced’ refers to persons held in prisons, penal institutions or correctional institutions who are untried, pre-trial or awaiting a first instance decision on their case from a competent authority regarding their conviction or acquittal. Persons held before and during the trial should be included. Sentenced persons held awaiting the outcome of an appeal in respect of verdict or sentence or who are within the statutory limits for appealing their sentence should be excluded."
209,Indicator16-3-3,"Proportion of the population who have experienced a dispute in the past two years and who accessed a formal or informal dispute resolution mechanism, by type of mechanism","Definition:Number of persons who experienced a dispute during the past two years who accessed a formal or informal dispute resolution mechanism, as a percentage of all those who experienced a dispute in the past two years, by type of mechanism. Concepts:A dispute can be understood as a justiciable problem between individuals or between individual(s) and an entity. Justiciable problems can be seen as the ones giving rise to legal issues, whether or not  the problems are perceived as being “legal” by those who face them, and whether or not any legal action was taken as a result of the problem.Categories of disputes can vary between countries depending on social, economic, political, legal, institutional and cultural factors. There are, however, a number of categories that have broad applicability across countries, such as problems or disputes related to:Land or buying and selling propertyFamily and relationship break-upsInjuries or illnesses caused by an intentional or unintentional act or omission of another person or entityOccupation/employmentCommercial transactions (including defective or undelivered goods or services)Government and public services (including abuse by public officials)Government payments Housing (Tenancy and landlord) Debt, damage compensation, and other financial mattersEnvironmental damage (land or water pollution, waste dumping, etc.)Dispute resolution mechanisms vary across countries around the world. While in many countries courts represent the main institution dealing with disputes of civil nature, the same may not be true in countries or societies where the first point of reference in such cases are informal systems, traditional or religious leaders. The formulation of the indicator, and the formulation of the questions in the survey, have to account for these differences and make sure to include all relevant institutions     or mechanisms that are generally recognized and used.A list of dispute resolution mechanisms could include: Lawyer or third-party mediationCommunity or religious leaders or other customary law mechanisms A court or tribunalThe policeA government office or other formal designated authority or agencyOther formal complaints or appeal procedure To improve the accuracy of the indicator it is important to define precisely the denominator (the population at ‘risk’ of experiencing the event of interest, i.e. accessing a dispute-resolution mechanism) by identifying the ‘demand’ of dispute resolution mechanisms. This demand is composed of those who use dispute resolution mechanisms (users) and those who - despite needing them - do not have “access” to such mechanisms for various reasons such as lack of knowledge on how to access them, lack of trust in institutions, lack of legal advice/assistance, lack of awareness about justice mechanisms, geographical distance or financial costs, to mention a few. It is important to exclude from the demand those who experience disputes and do not turn to dispute resolution mechanisms because they do not need them (voluntarily self-excluded). This refers to cases where the dispute is simple or when respondents solve the issue with the other party through direct negotiation."
210,Indicator16-4-1,Total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows (in current United States dollars),"Definition:The indicator measures the total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows (IFFs) in current United States dollars. IFFs are defined as “financial flows that are illicit in origin, transfer or use, that reflect an exchange of value and that cross country borders”.Concepts:IFFs have the following features: Illicit in origin, transfer or use. A flow of value is considered illicit if it is illicitly generated (e.g., originates from criminal activities or tax evasion), illicitly transferred (e.g., violating currency controls) or illicitly used (e.g., for financing terrorism). The flow can be legallygenerated, transferred or used, but it must be illicit in at least one of these aspects. Some flows that are not strictly illegal may fall within the definition of IFFs for statistical purposes, for example, cross-border aggressive tax avoidance which erodes the tax base of a country where that income was generated. Exchange of value, rather than purely financial transfers. Exchange of value includes exchange of goods and services, and financial and non-financial assets. For instance, illicit cross-border bartering, meaning the illicit exchange of goods and services for other goods and services, is a common practice in illegal markets and it is considered as IFF.IFFs measure a flow of value over a given time - as opposed to a stock measure, which would be the accumulation of value. Flows that cross a border. This includes assets that cross borders and assets where the ownership changes from a resident of a country to a non-resident, even if the assets remain in the same jurisdiction. There are four main types of activities that can generate IFFs:Illicit tax and commercial practices: These include illicit practices by legal entities as well as arrangements and individuals with the objective of concealing revenues and reducing tax burden through evading controls and regulations. This category can be divided into two components: IFFs from illegal commercial activities and tax evasion. These include illegal practices such as tariff, duty and revenue offences, tax evasion, competition offences and market manipulation amongst others, as included in the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS). Most of these activities are non-observed, hidden or part of the shadow, underground or informal economy that may generate IFFs. IFFs from aggressive tax avoidance. Illicit flows can also be generated from legal economic activities through aggressive tax avoidance. This can take place through the manipulation of transfer pricing, strategic location of debt and intellectual property, tax treaty shopping and the use of hybrid instruments and entities. These flows need to be carefully considered, as they generally arise from legal business transactions and only the illicit part of the cross-border flows belongs within the scope of IFFs.IFFs from illegal markets: These include trade in illicit goods and services when the corresponding financial flows cross borders. The focus is on criminal activities where income is generated through exchange (trade) of illegal goods or services. Such processes often involve a degree of criminal organisation aimed at creating profit. They include any type of trafficking in goods, such as drugs and firearms, or services, such as smuggling of migrants. IFFs emerge from transnational trade in illicit goods and services, as well as from cross-border flows from managing the illicit income from such activities.IFFs from corruption: The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) defines acts considered as corruption, and they are consistently defined in the ICCS, such as bribery, embezzlement, abuse of functions, trading in influence, illicit enrichment and other acts of corruption in the scope. When these acts – directly or indirectly - generate cross-border flows, they generate IFFs. Exploitation-type activities, and financing of crime and terrorism: Exploitation-type activities are non-productive activities that entail a forced, involuntary and illicit transfer of economic resources between two actors. Terrorism financing and financing of crime are illicit, voluntary transfers of funds between two actors. Examples of exploitation-type activities are sexual exploitation, theft, extortion, illicit enrichment, and kidnapping. When the related financial flows cross country borders, they constitute IFFs.Other relevant concepts include:Inward IFFs: IFFs entering a country.Outward IFFs: IFFs leaving a country.Illicit income generation: This refers to the set of transactions that either directly generate illicit income for an actor during a productive or non-productive illicit activity, or that are performed in the context of the production of illicit goods and services. A transaction constitutes an IFF when it crosses country borders.Illicit income management: These transactions use illicit income to invest in (legal or illegal) financial and non-financial assets or to consume (legal or illegal) goods and services. A transaction constitutes an IFFs when it crosses country borders.Illegal markets comprise all transactions related to the production and the trade with a certain illicit good or service. Regardless of the illicit nature, these market activities are considered as being economically productive, because value added is generated at each transaction. The value added describes the net increase in value (price times quantity) of the product at each transaction."
211,Indicator16-4-2,"Proportion of seized, found or surrendered arms whose illicit origin or context has been traced or established by a competent authority in line with international instruments","Definition:Proportion of seized, found or surrendered arms whose illicit origin or context has been traced or established by a competent authority in line with international instrumentsConcepts:Arms: arms refer to ‘small arms and light weapons’, defined as any portable lethal weapon that expels or launches, is designed to expel or launch, or may be readily converted to expel or launch a shot, bullet or projectile by the action of an explosive, excluding antique small arms and light weapons or their replicas. Antique small arms and light weapons and their replicas will be defined in accordance with domestic law, and in no case will they include those manufactured after 1899. Arms include all firearms, as defined in the “Protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition”. In particular, ‘small arms’ are, broadly speaking, weapons for individual use, including revolvers, pistols, rifles and carbines, shotguns, sub-machine guns and light machine guns. ‘Light weapons’ are, broadly speaking, weapons designed for use by two or three persons serving as a crew, although some may be carried and used by a single person. They include, heavy machine guns, hand-held under-barrel and mounted grenade launchers, portable anti-aircraft guns, portable anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, portable launchers of anti-tank missile and rocket systems, portable launchers of anti-aircraft missile systems, and mortars of a calibre of less than 100 millimetres.Seized: arms that have been physically apprehended during the reported period by a competent authority, whether temporarily or not, in relation to a suspected criminal offence or administrative violation related to these arms. For the purpose of the calculation of indicator 16.4.2, only arms that were seized due to criminal offences are considered.Found: arms apprehended by authorities that are not linked to an intentional or planned investigation or inspection, neither attributable to any apparent holder or owner, regardless of whether the items were reported lost or stolen. Surrendered: arms willingly handed over to authorities that are not linked to a planned investigation or inspection. The surrender may occur as a personal initiative of a citizen in the context of a voluntary surrender campaign and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration processes, inter alia.Illicit origin: Earliest point in time in the life of an arm where it was of an illicit nature. In order to establish the illicit origin, it is necessary to identify the point of diversion of the arm and the circumstances around it.Point of diversion: the point in space and time and/or circumstances when arms left the licit circuit and entered the illicit one. If identified through tracing, the last legal record needs to be found. For arms illicitly manufactured, the point of diversion is the manufacture itself. Last legal record: last recorded information available about the item, its status (deactivated, stolen, lost, seized, found, surrendered, sent for destruction, confiscated, in transit, etc.) and its legal end-user.  The identification of the last legal record may require the initiation of several individual tracing requests.Tracing: the systematic tracking of weapons and, where possible, their parts and components, and ammunition, at the national and/or international level for the purpose of assisting the competent authorities of States parties in detecting, investigating and analysing illicit manufacturing and illicit trafficking.Illicit origin established by a competent authority in line with international instruments: illicit origin established through means other than tracing, e.g. through intelligence. In the case of arms that are not traceable, this is the only mean to establishing the illicit origin. "
212,Indicator16-5-1,"Proportion of persons who had at least one contact with a public official and who paid a bribe to a public official, or were asked for a bribe by those public officials, during the previous 12 months","Definition:This indicator is defined as the percentage of persons who paid at least one bribe (gave a public official money, a gift or counter favour) to a public official, or were asked for a bribe by these public officials, in the last 12 months, as a percentage of persons who had at least one contact with a public official in the same period.Concepts:In the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), bribery is defined as: ‘Promising, offering, giving, soliciting, or accepting an undue advantage to or from a public official or a person who directs or works in a private sector entity, directly or indirectly, in order that the person act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her official duties’ (ICCS Category 07031). This definition is based on definitions of bribery of national public officials, bribery of foreign public officials and official of international organisations and bribery in the private sector that are contained in the United Nations Convention against Corruption (articles 15, 16, and 21).While the concept of bribery is broader, as it includes also actions such as promising or offering, and it covers both public and private sector, this indicator focuses on specific forms of bribery that are more measurable (the giving and/or requesting of bribes) and it limits the scope to the public sector.The concept of undue advantage is operationalized by reference to giving of money (in addition to an official fee), gifts or provision of a service requested/offered by/to a public official in exchange for a special treatment.This indicator captures the often called ‘administrative bribery’, which is often intended as the type of bribery affecting citizens in their dealings with public administrations and/or civil servants.For this indicator, public official refers to persons holding a legislative, executive, administrative or judicial office. In the operationalization of the indicator, a list of selected officials and civil servants is used."
213,Indicator16-5-2,"Proportion of businesses that had at least one contact with a public official and that paid a bribe to a public official, or were asked for a bribe by those public officials during the previous 12 months","Definition:The percent of firms experiencing at least one bribe payment request across 6 public transactions dealing with utilities access, permits, licenses, and taxes. In every Enterprise Survey (www.enterprisesurveys.org), there are standard questions which ask the survey respondent if they were expected to give a gift or informal payment during a transaction with a public official. There are six, separate transactions which make up this indicator, they include an application for an electrical connection, an application for a water connection, an application for a construction-related permit, an application for an import license, an application for an operating license, and during an inspection/meeting with tax officials. In all of these transactions, if the respondent indicates ‘yes’ they had the transaction (e.g. they applied for an import license), then there is a follow-up question which asks if the respondent was expected to provide a gift or an informal payment during this transaction (an application or meeting). The response options include “yes”, “no”, “don’t know”,and “refuse”. Note that refusals are accepted and recorded but for the purposes of indicator construction, refusals are considered as a ‘yes’. The indicator 16.5.2 is measuring whether the respondent indicated ‘yes’ to a bribe payment for any of these six transactions.Enterprise Surveys are firm-level surveys conducted in World Bank client countries. The survey focuses on various aspects of the business environment as well as firm’s outcome measures such as annual sales, productivity, etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews with the top manager or business owner. For each country, the survey is conducted approximately every 4-5 years.Concepts:The respondents to the Enterprise Survey are firms- either manufacturing or services establishments. These are registered (formal) firms with 5+ employees. The firms are either fully or partially private (100% state-owned firms are ineligible for the Enterprise Survey). More information on the survey methodology can be found on the Methodology page of the website: www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodologyA gift or an informal payment is considered a ‘bribe’."
214,Indicator16-6-1,"Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (or by budget codes or similar)","Definition:Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budgetThis indicator measures the extent to which aggregate budget expenditure outturn reflects the amount originally approved, as defined in government budget documentation and fiscal reports. The coverage is budgetary central government (BCG) and the time period covers every fiscal year for the countries..Concepts:Aggregate expenditure includes actual expenditures incorporating those incurred as a result of unplanned or exceptional events—for example, armed conflicts or natural disasters. Expenditures financed by windfall revenues, including privatization, should be included and noted in the supporting fiscal tables and narrative. Expenditures financed externally by loans or grants should be included, if covered by the budget, along with contingency vote(s) and interest on debt. Expenditure assigned to suspense accounts is not included in the aggregate. However, if amounts are held in suspense accounts at the end of any year that could affect the scores if included in the calculations, they can be included. In such cases the reason(s) for inclusion must be clearly stated.Actual expenditure outturns can deviate from the originally approved budget for reasons unrelated to the accuracy of forecasts—for example, as a result of a major macroeconomic shock. The calibration of this indicator accommodates one unusual or “outlier” year and focuses on deviations from the forecast which occur in two of the three years covered by the assessment.Very detailed resources are available at www.pefa.org. The document directly related to the SDG Indicator 16.6.1 is the “PEFA Framework for assessing public financial management” : https://www.pefa.org/resources/pefa-2016-framework). There are seven Pillars in this document containing a total of 31 indicators. The pillar containing the indicator PI-1 corresponding to SDG 16.6.1 is part of Pillar I which measures Budget reliability. The SDG 16.6.1 Indicator follows the definition and concept for PEFA PI-1 Indicator in PEFA Framework with the only difference that the budget deviations for PI-1 are computed based on three years country performance, while the SDG 16.6.1 indicator is based on the annual budgets deviations."
215,Indicator16-6-2,Proportion of population satisfied with their last experience of public services,"Definition:This indicator measures levels of public satisfaction with people’s last experience with public services, in the three service areas of healthcare, education and government services (i.e. services to obtain government-issued identification documents and services for the civil registration of life events such as births, marriages and deaths). This is a survey-based indicator which emphasizes citizens’ experiences over general perceptions, with an eye on measuring the availability and quality of services as they were actually delivered to survey respondents. Respondents are asked to reflect on their last experience with each service, and to provide a rating on five ‘attributes’, or service-specific standards, of healthcare, education and government services (such as access, affordability, quality of facilities, etc.). A final question asks respondents for their overall satisfaction level with each service. It is recommended that survey results, at a minimum, be disaggregated by sex, income and place of residence (urban/rural, administrative regions). To the extent possible, all efforts should be made to also disaggregate results by disability status and by ‘nationally relevant population groups’.A detailed questionnaire and implementation manual to produce the indicator is defined in the SDG 16 Survey Initiative: The questions for 16.6.2 on healthcare, education and government services can be inserted into existing surveys, using these surveys’ additional batteries on demographics for subsequent disaggregation of results. This modular ‘add-on’ technique also allows for the cross-tabulation of satisfaction levels with other socioeconomic variables found in the larger survey, such as the health conditions of the respondent. This enables a more comprehensive analysis of disparities in the provision of services, and helps to pinpoint specific factors that influence satisfaction levels.  Concepts:Public services: As stated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, “States are responsible for delivering a variety of services to their populations, including education, health and social welfare services. The provision of these services is essential to the protection of human rights such as the right to housing, health, education and food. The role of the public sector as service provider or regulator of the private provision of services is crucial for the realization of all human rights, particularly social and economic rights.” While several definitions of ‘public services’ exist, they tend to have in common a focus on ‘common interest' and on ‘government responsibility’. For instance, the European Commission defines such services as “Services that public authorities of the Member States clarify as being of general interest and, therefore, subject to specific public service obligations.” Similarly, the African Charter on Values and Principles of Public Service and Administration (African Union, 2011) defines a public service as “Any service or public-interest activity that is under the authority of the government administration”. Public services ‘of general interest’: The methodology for SDG 16.6.2 carefully defines the scope of healthcare and education services to ensure that the focus is placed on services that are truly of general interest. In the case of healthcare services, for instance, preventive and primary healthcare services can be said to be truly ‘of general interest’: these services are relevant to everyone and they are most commonly found in both urban and rural areas. This might not be the case for hospitals that provide tertiary care, and as such hospital and specialist care is excluded from the questions on healthcare services. Likewise, in the case of education services, primary and lower secondary education services can be said to be truly ‘of general interest’, given their universality. University education, however, is excluded from the questions on education services. ‘Last experience’ of public services in the past 12 months: Indicator 16.6.2 focuses on respondents’ ‘last experience of public services’, and specifies a reference period of “the past 12 months” to avoid telescoping effects and to minimize memory bias effects. This means that only respondents who will have used healthcare, education and government services in the past 12 months will proceed to answer the survey questions. Service-specific standards – or ‘attributes’: The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights explains that “A human rights-based approach to public services is integral to the design, delivery, implementation and monitoring of all public service provision. Firstly, the normative human rights framework provides an important legal yardstick for measuring how well public service is designed and delivered and whether the benefits reach rights-holders”. For instance, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights specifies that “The availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health-related services should be facilitated and controlled by States. This duty extends to a variety of health-related services ranging from controlling the spread of infectious diseases to ensuring maternal health and adequate facilities for children.” Similarly, with respect to education services, the same Committee underlines that “States should adopt a human rights approach to ensure that [education services are] of an adequate standard and do not exclude any child on the basis of race, religion, geographical location or any other defining characteristic.”  Healthcare services: The questions on healthcare services focus on respondents’ experiences (or that of a child in their household who needed treatment and was accompanied by the respondent) with primary healthcare services (over the past 12 months) – that is, basic health care services provided by a government/public health clinic, or covered by a public health system. It can include health care services provided by private institutions, as long as such services are provided at reduced (or no) cost to beneficiaries, under a public health system. Respondents are specifically asked not to include in their answers any experience they might have had with hospital or specialist medical care services (for example, if they had a surgery), or with dental care and teeth exams (because in many countries, dental care is not covered by publicly funded healthcare systems). Attributes-based questions on healthcare services focus on 1) Accessibility (related to geographic proximity, delay in getting appointment, waiting time to see doctor on day of appointment); 2) Affordability; 3) Quality of facilities; 4) Equal treatment for everyone; and 5) Courtesy and treatment (attitude of healthcare staff).Education services: The questions on education services focuses on respondents’ experience with the public school system over the past 12 months, that is, if there are children in their household whose age falls within the age range spanning primary and secondary education in the country. Public schools are defined as “those for which no private tuition fees or major payments must be paid by the parent or guardian of the child who is attending the school; they are state-funded schools.” Respondents are asked to respond separately for primary and secondary schools if children in their household attend school at different levels. Attributes-based questions on education services focus on 1) Accessibility (with a focus on geographic proximity); 2) Affordability; 3) Quality of facilities; 4) Equal treatment for everyone; and 5) Effective delivery of service (Quality of teaching).Government services: The battery on government services focuses exclusively on two types of government services: 1) Services to obtain government-issued identification documents (such as national identity cards, passports, driver’s licenses and voter’s cards) and 2) services for the civil registration of life events such as births, marriages and deaths. This particular focus on these two types of services arises from the high frequency of use of these services. Attributes-based questions on government services focus on 1) Accessibility; 2) Affordability; 3) Equal treatment for everyone; 4) Effective delivery of service (delivery process is simple and easy to understand); and 5) Timeliness. Selection of relevant disaggregation dimensions  Relevant international legal frameworks: Indicator 16.6.2 aims to provide a better understanding of how access to services and the quality of services differ across localities and across various demographic groups. This aim is supported by international human rights law:  Article 25 (c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides for the right to equal access to public service. In its report on the role of the public services as an essential component in the promotion and protection of human rights, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reminds that “States must bear in mind that there are demographic groups in every society that may be disadvantaged in their access to public services, namely women, children, migrants, persons with disabilities, indigenous persons and older persons. States need to ensure that the human rights of these groups are not undermined and that they receive adequate public services.” The High Commissioner also calls attention to the fact that “Poverty acts as a major barrier in relation to public services.”  The obligations to ensure equality and non-discrimination are recognized in article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and are encountered in many United Nations human rights instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (arts. 2 and 26), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 2 (2)), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 2), the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (art. 7) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (art. 5). In terms of public services, this means that States have an immediate obligation to ensure that deliberate, targeted measures are put into place to secure substantive equality and that all individuals have an equal opportunity to enjoy their right to access public services.Empirical analysis: Statistical analysis of available datasets on citizen satisfaction with healthcare and education services shows that the demographic variables that are most strongly correlated with satisfaction with healthcare and education services are (1) income (by far the strongest determinant of satisfaction levels), (2) sex, and (3) place of residence (rural/urban). There is no statistically significant association between the age of respondents and satisfaction levels. "
216,Indicator16-7-1,"Proportions of positions in national and local institutions, including (a) the legislatures; (b) the public service; and (c) the judiciary, compared to national distributions, by sex, age, persons with disabilities and population groups","Definition:This metadata sheet is focused only on the first sub-component of indicator 16.7.1, namely on positions in national legislatures held by individuals of each target population (sex, age, persons with disabilities, and contextually relevant population groups). The legislative sub-component of indicator 16.7.1 aims to measure how representative of the general population are the individuals occupying key decision-making positions in national legislatures. More specifically, this indicator measures the proportional representation of various demographic groups (women, age groups) in the national population amongst individuals occupying the following positions in national legislatures: (1) Members, (2) Speakers and (3) Chairs of permanent committees in charge of the following portfolios: Foreign Affairs, Defence, Finance, Human Rights and Gender Equality. Furthermore, it looks at the electoral and constitutional provisions adopted by countries to secure representation in national legislatures of persons with disabilities and contextually relevant population groups. Concepts:The indicator is based on the following key concepts and terms:  National legislature: A legislature (alternatively called ‘assembly’ or ‘parliament’) is the multi-member branch of government that considers public issues, makes laws and oversees the executive.  Unicameral / bicameral parliaments: A legislature may consist of a single chamber (unicameral parliament) or two chambers (bicameral parliament). The organization of a country’s legislature is prescribed by its constitution. Around the world, about 59% of all countries have unicameral legislatures, while the remaining 41% are bicameral. To allow for a comprehensive analysis, this indicator will consider both chambers in bicameral parliaments.Member of Parliament (MP): A person who is formally an elected or appointed member of a national legislature. This metadata considers all members of lower and upper chamber regardless of the selection modality (direct election, indirect election and appointment).Speaker: A Speaker (alternatively called ‘president’ or ‘chairperson’ of the legislature) is the presiding officer of the legislature.Permanent committee (alternatively called ‘standing committee’): established for the full duration of the legislature and generally aligned with the specific policy areas of key government departments. For the purpose of SDG indicator 16.7.1(a), the permanent committees in charge of five portfolios are being considered: Foreign Affairs, Defence, Finance, Human Rights and Gender Equality.Permanent Committee Chair: A person designated to preside over the work of a permanent committee, selected through nomination by political parties, election by MPs, appointment by the Speaker, or other means. Disability: long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder the full and effective participation of disabled persons in society on an equal basis with others.Population group: The population of a country is a mosaic of different population groups that can be identified according to racial or ethnic, language, migration status, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, as well as disability status (UNECE). The indicator adopts a broad definition of population groups, not limited to minorities and indigenous peoples, in order to capture all nationally relevant groups tracked by a given parliament, which depends on the constitutional and electoral measures in place to guarantee the representation of certain groups. Such measures sometimes extend to groups other than ‘minorities’, such as, for instance, occupational groups."
217,Indicator16-7-2,"Proportion of population who believe decision-making is inclusive and responsive, by sex, age, disability and population group","Definition:This survey-based indicator measures self-reported levels of ‘external political efficacy’, that is, the extent to which people think that politicians and/or political institutions will listen to, and act on, the opinions of ordinary citizens. To address both dimensions covered by this indicator, SDG indicator 16.7.2 uses two well-established survey questions, namely: 1) one question measuring the extent to which people feel they have a say in what the government does (focus on inclusive participation in decision-making) and 2) another question measuring the extent to which people feel the political system allows them to have an influence on politics (focus on responsive decision-making).All efforts should be made to disaggregate survey results on these two questions by sex, age group, income level, education level, place of residence (administrative region e.g. province, state, district; urban/rural), disability status, and nationally relevant population groups. A detailed questionnaire and implementation manual to produce the indicator is defined in the SDG 16 Survey Initiative   ConceptsDecision-making: It is implicit in indicator 16.7.2 that ‘decision-making’ refers to decision-making in the public governance realm (and not all decision-making). Inclusive decision-making: Decision-making processes which provide people with an opportunity to ‘have a say’, that is, to voice their demands, opinions and/or preferences to decision-makers. Responsive decision-making: Decision-making processes where politicians and/or political institutions listen to and act on the stated demands, opinions and/or preferences of people."
218,Indicator16-8-1,Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations,"Definition:The indicator Proportion of members and voting rights of developing countries in international organizations has two separate components: the developing country proportion of voting rights and the developing country proportion of membership in international organisations. In some institutions, these two components are identical.The indicator is calculated independently for eleven different international institutions: The United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organisation, and the Financial Stability Board.Concepts:There is no established convention for the designation of ""developed"" and ""developing"" countries or areas in the United Nations system. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the “historical” classification of “Developed regions” and “Developing regions” as of December 2021 in the United Nations M49 statistical standard. The removal of this classification from the M49 standard at the end of 2021 makes it more urgent to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG monitoring. The designations ""developed"" and developing"" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process."
219,Indicator16-9-1,"Proportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age","Definition:Proportion of children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority.Concepts:•	Birth registration: Birth registration is defined as ‘the continuous, permanent and universal recording, within the civil registry, of the occurrence and characteristics of births in accordance with the legal requirements of a country’.•	Birth certificate: A birth certificate is a vital record that documents the birth of a child. The term ‘birth certificate’ can refer either to the original document certifying the circumstances of the birth, or to a certified copy or representation of the registration of that birth, depending on the practices of the country issuing the certificate.•	Civil authority: Official authorized to register the occurrence of a vital event and to record the required details."
220,Indicator16-10-1,"Number of verified cases of killing, kidnapping, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention and torture of journalists, associated media personnel, trade unionists and human rights advocates in the previous 12 months","Definition:This indicator is defined as the number of verified cases of killing, enforced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, kidnapping and other harmful acts committed against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders on an annual basis.‘Journalists’ refers to everyone who observes, describes, documents and analyses events, statements, policies, and any propositionsthat can affect society, with the purpose of systematizing such information and gathering of facts and analyses to inform sectors of society or soci ety as a whole, and others who share these journalistic functions, including all media workers and supportstaff,   as   well  as   community   media  workers   and   so-called  “citizen journalists”  when  they momentarily play that role,2 professional full-time reporters and analysts, as well as bloggers and others who engage in forms of self-publication in print, on the internet or elsewhere.3‘Trade unionists’ refers to everyone exercising their right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of their interests.4 A trade union is an association of workers organized to protect and promote their common interests.5‘Human rights defenders’ refers to everyone exercising their right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at national and international levels,6 including some journalists and trade unionists. While the term ‘human rights advocate’ is broadly speaking a synonymous of ‘human rights defender,’ the latter is preferred as it is more consistent with internationally agreed human rights standards and established practice.The different categories of violations tracked by the indicator have been defined in accordance with international law and methodological standards and monitoring practices developed by the OHCHR and other international mechanisms and classified drawing on the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) disseminated by the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC). As such:‘Killing’ is defined as any extrajudicial execution or other unlawful killing by State actors or other actors acting with the State’s permission, support or acquiescence that were motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender; or while the victim was engaged in such activities; or by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the State whose harmful acts were either motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, and/or met by a failure of due diligence on the part of the State in responding to these harmful acts, such a failu re motivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender; and other unlawful attacks and destruction in violation ofinternational humanitarian law leading to or intending to cause the victim’s death., corresponding to ICCS codes 0101, 0102 and 110139 and coded herein as A [0101, 0102and 110139].`Enforced disappearance’ refers to the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty of a victim by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation2 A/HRC/20/17, para 43 Human Rights Committee, General Comment 34, para 444UDHR, Art. 23, 4, supplemented by ICESCR, Article 85 ILO, Glossary on Labour Law and Industrial Relations (with special reference to the European Union)(Geneva, 2005) p 2506 Article 1, Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, UNGA Res 53/144, A/RES/53/1of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the victim, which places the victim outside the protection of the law, corresponding to ICCS code 020222 (forced disappearance) and coded herein as B [02022ED]‘Torture’ refers to any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, for such purposes as obtaining from them or a third person information or a confession, punishing them, intimidating them or coercing them, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other persons acting in an official capacity, corresponding to ICCS code 11011 and coded herein as C [11011].‘Arbitrary detention’ refers to any arrest or detention not in accordance with national laws, because it is not properly based on grounds established by law, or does not conform to the procedures established by law, or is otherwise deemed arbitrary in the sense of being inappropriate, unjust, unreasonable or unnecessary in the circumstances, and motivated by the victim, or someone associated with the victim, engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS code 020222 (unlawful deprivation of liberty) and coded herein as D [020222AD]‘Kidnapping’ refers to unlawfully detaining, taking away and/or confining a victim without their consent by persons or groups not acting with the support or acquiescence of the State, and the unlawful detention and/or confinement was met by a failure of due diligence on the part of the State in responding to the unlawful detention, such a failure motivated by the victim or associate engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS codes 020221 and coded herein as E [020221]‘Other harmful acts’ refers to other acts by State actors or other actors acting with theState’s permission, support or acquiescence causing harm or intending to cause harm and motivated by the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist or human rights defender, corresponding to ICCS codes 0301, 0219, 110133, 02012, 0205, 0208,0210 and 0211, and coded herein as F [0301, 0219, 110133, 02012, 0205, 0208, 0210 and0211].‘Verified cases’ refer to reported cases that contain a minimum set of relevant information on particular persons and circumstances, which have been reviewed by mandated bodies, mechanisms, and institutions, and provided them with reasonable grounds to believe those persons were victims of the above-mentioned human rights violations or abuses.Concepts:The operational definitions of the cases, victims and other elements of the indicator have been patterned as far as practicable after corresponding categories in ICCS. The task of classifying cases entails observing events from both statistical standards and international law perspectives. For example, intentional homicide (ICCS code 0101) is included as a component of the violation type ‘killing’ and is in turn supplemented by applicable human rights standards:0101 Intentional homicide. Inclusions: murder; serious assault leading to death; femicide ; honour killing; voluntary manslaughter; killings caused by excessive use of force by law enforcement officials; extrajudicial and extra-legal, summary or arbitrary executions. [human rights standards added in italics]This conceptual approach is necessitated by the confluence of three factors. First is the principle that all the violent acts tracked by the indicator are motivated by the exercise of fundamental freedoms that are guaranteed by human rights law to all persons. Second, while human rights abuses are not always explicitly criminalized in domestic jurisdictions, ICCS has achieved a certain level of success in terms of integrating human rights elements in the classification of crimes.Third, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislation or practices, all events – whether ordinary crimes or human rights violations – that meet the elements provided in the definitional framework will be counted for statistical purposes."
221,Indicator16-10-2,"Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information","Definition:Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information.The purpose of this indicator is to report the total of number of countries that adopted legal guarantees on ATI, as well as the main tendencies in the implementation of these guarantees, which are presented in global aggregates.Based on the definition above, the indicator has two components:1.	Adoption2.	ImplementationUnder each component, key questions were identified based on what can be called “Principles of Access to Information”, and which highlight essential components for effective implementation of Access to Information implementation at the country level. These Principles are synthesized from existing frameworks and documents recognised internationally.  For the purpose of this survey, the principles of relevance are as follows:1.	Legal frameworks for Access to Information 2.	Limited exemptions3.	Oversight mechanism  4.	Appeals mechanism5.	Record keeping and reportingEach question values between 0 and 2. Upon the completion of the survey, a country can get a total score of 0-9.  The total score of each country will not be assigned to any level category (e.g.: low, medium or high). However, it will contribute to global aggregates.  More details on the computation method are under the section Methodology.Concepts:Access to Information“Public access to information” is based upon the established human right to the fundamental freedom of expression (FOE) and association. States are duty-bearers for this right and measuring the fulfilment of this duty allows for assessment of progress.In terms of defining what is being measured, Access to Information (ATI) has two principle components: the obligation for states to have a legal framework that is also implemented in practice, that: Entitles public to request access to information (documents and other information recorded in any format) and to respond to such requests in a timely fashion.   Obliges authorities to ensure that information of public interest is put into the public domain proactively, without the need for requests.Right to InformationThe right of access to public information (RTI) is a component of the fundamental right of freedom of expression as set forth by Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), and the subsequent International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These state that the fundamental right of freedom of expression encompasses the freedom ""to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers” (our italics). Seeking and receiving is the dimension of the right that is immediately relevant to this SDG indicator, with the right to impart information and ideas constituting the other side of the coin. RTI is an umbrella term that refers to the legal right to access information held by public bodies. It is often used in the same way as terms such as Freedom of Information (FOI). ImplementationThis refers primarily to efforts to give practical effect to the provisions of the law, policy or regulation. Implementation thus designates government bodies providing information to the public (on request as well as proactively). Implementation is important to ensure that the benefits of the law, policy or regulation are realized.Monitoring Monitoring the implementation of access to information refers to the supervision and examination conducted by the dedicated Access to Information oversight institution to ensure effective application of the legal guarantee(s). This includes a role in assessing efforts made by public bodies with a view to advance access to information in the country. Enforcement Enforcement of compliance with Access to Information legal guarantee(s) refers to the actions of obliging adherence by duty-bearers to the respective requirements and the implementation of sanctions when violations are found. Enforcement is a disciplinary function that seeks to ensure that there are consequences to the violation of rules, involving a set of tools used to punish breaches of laws and regulations, and to deter future violations.MediationMediation is a negotiation facilitated by a neutral third party (a mediator). Mediation does not involve decision making by the neutral third party. Unlike a judge or an arbitrator, therefore, the mediator is not a decision-maker. In mediation, the disputing parties work with the mediator to resolve their disputes. The mediator assists the parties in reaching their own decision on a settlement of the dispute by supervising the exchange of information and the bargaining process. Dedicated oversight This specialist function covers the process of supervision, monitoring, evaluation of performance and review, to ensure compliance with laws, regulations and policies. It entails assessing and enforcing implementation. Oversight of implementation is thus different to executing the actual implementation itself in regard to the direct provision of information. An oversight institution refers to the body charged with ensuring Oversight and therefore accountability for the implementation of ATI. The same body or another may also do appeals, although appeals is a distinct function from oversight and are sometimes done by a separate body. This is why some countries, there exists more than one oversight institution, depending on the different tasks performed. The oversight function can be exercised by the following (indicative) institutions: Information Commission/ Commissioner;Data Protection or Privacy Commission / CommissionerHuman Rights CommissionOmbudsmanDepartment/ Ministry/ AgencyAppeals An appeal is an application for a decision (or lack of a decision) relating to a request for information, to be reviewed by the Access to Information oversight institution that is tasked with this. Appeals normally involve requests to reconsider failures by duty-bearers to provide information. Ideally, an independent and impartial review body will be established with the power to compel disclosure. While in some jurisdictions, courts may be an effective alternative to a review body, they can be slow and expensive, and therefore may prevent many people from seeking review. Appeals to a court should normally be a last resort once institutional appeal processes are exhausted, and this realm is treated as outside the scope of this indicator. Limited exemptions Exemptions (or exceptions) allow the withholding of certain categories of information. Limited exemptions mean that such withholding must be based on narrow, proportionate, necessary and clearly defined limitations. Exceptions should apply only where there is a risk of substantial harm to the protected interest and where the harm is greater the overall public interest in having access to the information. Bodies should provide reasons for any refusal to provide access to information.Several permissible exemptions include:national security; international relations; public health and safety; the prevention, investigation and prosecution of legal wrongs; privacy; legitimate commercial and other economic interests; management of the economy; fair administration of justice and legal advice privilege; conservation of the environment; and legitimate policy making and other operations of public bodies.Record-keeping and reportingRecord-keeping is part of a records management system, which plays an important role in fostering accountability and good governance. Without adequate and reliable records of requests and/or appeals received and how they are processed, it would be difficult to measure, and report progress on access to information. In the implementation of access to information, reporting is an essential tool for transparency and accountability purposes, as well as for gathering evidence and data in mapping any gaps and needs as a precondition for making targeted improvements. Comments and limitations:The indicator allows for reporting the total number of countries that adopted constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information globally. Data on the implementation of these guarantees comes from entities that responded to UNESCO survey.In some countries, the oversight institutions for Access to Information that are the entities best placed to provide data for this survey, directly or indirectly, might not have an explicit monitoring role, or may have weak record-keeping situations. Hence, they might not be able to provide detailed information that could help contextualize the analysis. The indicator does not enter into whether the national measures taken do lead to further impacts. It focuses on the implementation of the regulatory environment and on the mandate and supporting systems that is are preconditions for effective implementation."
222,Indicator16-a-1,Existence of independent national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles,"Definition:This indicator Existence of independent national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles measures the compliance of existing national human rights institutions with the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles), which were adopted by the General Assembly (resolution 48/134) based on the rules of procedure of the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI, formerly the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights or ICC).Concepts:A National Human Rights Institution is an independent administrative body set up by a State to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are State bodies with a constitutional and/or legislative mandate to protect and promote human rights. They are part of the State apparatus and are funded by the State. However, they operate and function independently from government. While their specific mandate may vary, the general role of NHRIs is to address discrimination in all its forms, as well as to promote the protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Core functions of NHRIs include complaint handling, human rights education and making recommendations on law reform. Effective NHRIs are an important link between government and civil society, in so far as they help bridge the 'protection gap' between the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of the State. Six models of NHRIs exist across all regions of the world today, namely: Human rights commissions, Human rights ombudsman institutions, Hybrid institutions, Consultative and advisory bodies, Institutes and centers and multiple institutions. An Independent NHRI is an institution with ‘A level’ accreditation status as benchmarked against the Paris Principles. The process of accreditation is conducted through peer review by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of the GAHNRI. There are three possible types of accreditation: A: Compliance with Paris Principles B: Observer Status – Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination C: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles Accreditation by the GANHRI entails a determination whether the NHRI is compliant, both in law and practice, with the Paris principles, the principal source of the normative standards for NHRIs, as well as with the General Observations developed by the SCA. Other international standards may also be taken into account by the SCA, including the provisions related to the establishment of national mechanisms in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well as in the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Likewise, the SCA looks at any NHRI-related recommendation from the international human rights mechanisms, notably, the Treaty Bodies, Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and special procedures. The process also looks into the effectiveness and level of engagement with international human rights systems.The Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles) adopted by General Assembly, Resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993 provide the international benchmarks against which NHRIs can be accredited by the GANHRI."
223,Indicator16-b-1,Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law,"Definition:This indicator is defined as the proportion of the population (adults) who self-report that they personally experienced discrimination or harassment during the last 12 months based on ground(s) prohibited by international human rights law. International human rights law refers to the body of international legal instruments aiming to promote and protect human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent international human rights treaties adopted by the United Nations.Concepts:Discrimination is any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that is directly or indirectly based on prohibited grounds of discrimination, and which has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.  Harassment is a form of discrimination when it is also based on prohibited grounds of discrimination. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions, which tend to annoy, alarm, abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another or which create an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. While generally involving a pattern of behaviours, harassment can take the form of a single incident.International human rights law provides lists of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. The inclusion of “other status” in these lists indicate that they are not exhaustive and that other grounds may be recognized by international human rights mechanisms. A review of the international human rights normative framework helps identify a list of grounds that includes race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national origin, social origin, property, birth status, disability, age, nationality, marital and family status, sexual orientation, gender identity, health status, place of residence, economic and social situation, pregnancy, indigenous status, afro-descent and other status. In practice, it will be difficult to include all potentially relevant grounds of discrimination in household survey questions. For this reason, it is recommended that data collectors identify contextually relevant and feasible lists of grounds, drawing on the illustrative list and formulation of prohibited grounds of discrimination outlined in the methodology section below, and add an “other” category to reflect other grounds that may not have been listed explicitly."
224,Indicator17-1-1,"Total government revenue as a proportion of GDP, by source","Definition:Revenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) of Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 as an increase in net worth resulting from a transaction. It is a fiscal indicator for assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities. General government units have four types of revenue. The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social contributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government units. In particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from institutional units. Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make provision for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers receivable by government units from other resident or non-resident government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants. Other revenue comprises: (i) property income; (ii) sales of goods and services; (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere classified; and (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to non-life insurance and standardized guarantee schemes.Concepts:The transactions and the associated classifications are detailed in Chapter 5 of GFSM 2014 and are structured to demonstrate how general government (and public sector) units raise revenue. Only those taxes and social insurance contributions that are evidenced by tax assessments and declarations, customs declarations, and similar documents are considered to create revenue for government units. Thus, the difference between assessments and expected collections represents a claim that has no real value and should not be recorded as revenue (see GFSM 2014 paragraph 5.20). The analytic framework of GFSM 2014 (like that of the GFSM 2001) builds on the GFSM 1986 framework, and extends it by incorporating additional elements that are useful in assessing fiscal policy. An important example is the treatment of non-financial assets, where the sale of such assets is no longer included in revenue. The disposal of a non-financial asset by sale or barter is not revenue because it has no effect on net worth. Rather, it changes the composition of the balance sheet by exchanging one asset (the non-financial asset) for another (the proceeds of the sale). Similarly, amounts receivable from loan repayments and loan disbursements are not revenue. In general, transactions that increase net worth result from current operations. Capital transfers are an exception. In GFSM 2014, capital transfers receivables are classified as revenue because they increase the recipient’s net worth and they are often indistinguishable from current transfers in their effect on government operations. In recording cash-based accounting revenue transactions, data representing the tax payments received by government, net of refunds paid out during the period covered should be reported. These data will include taxes paid after the original assessment, taxes paid or refunds deducted from taxes after subsequent assessments, and taxes paid or refunds deducted after any subsequent reopening of the accounts. Therefore, total tax revenue could be presented on a gross basis as the total amount of all taxes accrued, or on a net basis as the gross amount minus tax refunds. Revenue categories are presented as gross of expense categories for the same or related category. In particular, interest revenue is presented as gross rather than as net interest expense or net interest revenue. Similarly, social benefits and social contributions, grant revenue and expense, and rent revenue and expense are presented gross. Also, sales of goods and services are presented gross of the expenses incurred in their production. In cases of erroneous or unauthorized transactions, revenue categories are presented net of refunds of the relevant revenue, and expense categories are presented net of inflows from the recovery of the expense. For example, refunds of income taxes may be paid when the amount of taxes withheld or otherwise paid in advance of the final determination exceeds the actual tax due. Such refunds are recorded as a reduction in tax revenue. For this reason, tax revenue is presented as net of non-payable tax credits (see GFSM 2014 paragraphs 5.29–5.32)."
225,Indicator17-1-2,Proportion of domestic budget funded by domestic taxes,"Definition: The precise definition of the indicator is the Proportion of domestic budgetary central government expenditure funded by taxes. Budgetary central government, described in the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 (paragraph 2.81) is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government’s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right (see GFSM 2014 paragraph 2.42).  including references to standards and classifications, preferably relying on international agreed definitions. The indicator definition should be unambiguous and expressed in universally applicable terms. It must clearly express the unit of measurement (proportion, dollars, number of people, etc.).Concepts:The key concepts and terms associated with the indicator are outlined in GFSM 2014, as are the associated classifications. Revenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) and the associated classifications are detailed in Chapter 5. Expenditure is also defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.21) while the associated detailed classifications and concepts used for calculating this aggregate are outlined in Chapter 6 - 8."
226,Indicator17-2-1,"Net official development assistance, total and to least developed countries, as a proportion of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee donors’ gross national income (GNI)","Definition:The indicator Net official development assistance, total and to least developed countries, as a proportion of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee donors' gross national income (GNI) is defined as Net ODA disbursements as a per cent of GNI.Concepts:ODA: The DAC defines ODA as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; andis concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)GNI is obtained by DAC reporters from their national statistical offices.Note: Since 2018, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD measures the headline ODA data as of 2018 on a grant equivalent basis. See references for more details."
227,Indicator17-3-1,Additional financial resources mobilized for developing countries from multiple sources,"Annual gross receipts by developing countries of: a. Official sustainable development grants, b. Official concessional sustainable development loans, c. Official non-concessional sustainable development loans, d. Foreign direct investment, e. Mobilised private finance (MPF) on an experimental basis, and f. Private grants.a. Official sustainable development grantsGrants are transfers in cash or in kind for which no legal debt is incurred by the recipient.b. Official concessional sustainable development loansLoans are transfers in cash or in kind for which the recipient incurs legal debt. A concessional transfer is one which gives something of value away. For the purposes of this indicator, a loan will be regarded as concessional if it embodies at least a 35% grant element when its service payments are discounted at 5% p.a. This test is derived from the World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries and has also been adopted in the TOSSD framework.See: https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2018/02/14/pp122617guidance-note-on-lic-dsfhttps://www.tossd.org/docs/reporting-instructions.pdfc. Official non-concessional sustainable development loansThese are loans (see above) which bear a grant element of less than 35% when their service payments are discounted at 5% p.a.d. Foreign direct investmentForeign direct investment (FDI) is a category of investment that reflects the objective of establishing a lasting interest by a resident enterprise in one economy (direct investor) in an enterprise (direct investment enterprise) that is resident in an economy other than that of the direct investor. The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. The direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting power of an enterprise resident in one economy by an investor resident in another economy is taken as evidence of such a relationship. For OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment - 4th Edition and UNCTAD work on Foreign Direct Investment Statistics.See:https://www.oecd.org/investment/fdibenchmarkdefinition.htmhttps://unctad.org/topic/investment/investment-statistics-and-trendsThis sub-indicator is not restricted to developing countries.e. Mobilised private finance (MPF) on an experimental basisMobilised private finance (MPF) consists of private resource flows for activities in developing countries which have been mobilised by interventions of multilateral development banks (MDBs), bilateral development finance institutions, or other bilateral agencies, i.e. where a direct causal link between the official intervention and the private resources can be demonstrated. The OECD method for counting MPF is used; see https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/mobilisation.htm. MPF is a “memorandum item” because it would likely include and overlap with some finance that would also be found in the FDI sub-indicator. MPF data are typically collected on a commitment basis, rather than in terms of developing country receipts. This indicator excludes private flows mobilised in recipient countries themselves as they do not constitute additional resources. The indicator is included on an experimental basis, and it is recommended that it be reviewed during the 2025 review of SDG indicators.f. Private grantsPrivate grants are here taken to mean grants for developmental purposes from private institutions outside the recipient country, excluding commercial flows and personal transactions such as remittances. They essentially comprise grants from philanthropic foundations and other non-governmental organizations.Sustainable development criteriaBased on the Group’s discussions, and building on the work of the TOSSD Task Force, the following cascading approach will be used to identify flows that can be considered as supporting sustainable development:1. Flows within the proposed indicators and sub-indicators detailed below and identified individually, such as a specific activity in provider reporting systems, should be included if they directly support either (i) at least one of the SDG targets or (ii) an objective in the recipient country’s development plan as long as this is directed towards supporting or achieving sustainable development, with the following exceptions:a. Flows for activities where a substantial detrimental effect is anticipated on one or more of the other targets. b. Flows where the recipient country, after discussion with the custodian agency and/or the reporting provider country, objects to their characterization as supporting its sustainable development. 2. Flows, or portions of flows within the proposed indicators and sub-indicators detailed below for which data are only available at the aggregate country-to-country level are also considered as supporting sustainable development, subject to the same exceptions as under 1.a and 1.b.Note that some sub-indicators may contain a mixture of activity-specific and aggregate-level flow data and therefore require assessment against 1 and 2 respectively. Also note that further specific exclusions are proposed, as detailed below, that may in some cases be considered to reinforce the focus of the proposed indicators on the sustainable development of developing countries."
228,Indicator17-3-2,Volume of remittances (in United States dollars) as a proportion of total GDP,"Definition:Personal remittances received as proportion of GDP is the inflow of personal remittances expressed as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Concepts:Personal remittances comprise of personal transfers and compensation of employees. Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from non-resident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and non-resident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by non-resident entities. Data are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees.The concepts used are in line with the Sixth Edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6)."
229,Indicator17-4-1,Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods and services,Definition:Debt service as proportion of exports of goods and services is the percentage of debt services (principle and interest payments) to the exports of goods and services. Debt services covered in this indicator refer only to public and publicly guaranteed debt.Concepts:Concepts of public and publicly guaranteed external debt data are in accordance with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) methodology.“Exports of goods and services” data concepts are in accordance with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6).
230,Indicator17-5-1,"Number of countries that adopt and implement investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including the least developed countries","Definition:The indicator provides the number of countries that have adopted and implemented investment promotion regimes for developing countries, including least developed countries (LDCs).Concepts:Investment promotion regimes can be defined as those instruments that directly aim at encouraging outward or inward foreign investment through particular measures of the home or host countries of investment. Investment promotion regimes for LDCs are those instruments that home countries of investors have put in place to encourage outward investment in LDCs directly or through measures intended for developing countries. Home country refers to donor countries that put in place investment promotion regimes to encourage outward investment which can benefit developing countries, including LDCs. Foreign direct investment involves a long-term relationship and reflects a lasting interest and control by a resident entity in one economy (foreign direct investor or parent enterprise) in an enterprise resident in an economy other than that of the foreign direct investor (FDI enterprise or affiliate enterprise or foreign affiliate).Adoption means that a country has put in place such a system i.e. through the formal adoption of a law, regulation or programme to encourage investment in developing countries, including LDCs. Implementation means that a country has actually started to promote individual investments in developing countries, including LDCs, on the basis of the relevant legislation. Instruments used under investment promotion regimes include investment guarantees, financial or fiscal support for outward investors. Besides these legal instruments, countries often also provide information and other advisory and investment facilitation services for their outward investors. Investment guarantee is an insurance, offered by governments of the home country or other institutions, to investors to protect against certain political risks in host countries, such as the risk of discrimination, expropriation, transfer restrictions or breach of contract."
231,Indicator17-6-1,"Fixed Internet broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, by speed","Definition:The indicator fixed broadband subscriptions, by speed, refers to the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions to the public Internet, broken down by advertised download speed.The indicator is currently broken down by the following subscription speeds:- 256 kbit/s to less than 2 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s and less than 2 Mbit/s.- 2 Mbit/s to less than 10 Mbit/s subscriptions: Refers to all fixed -broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 2 Mbit/s and less than 10 Mbit/s.- Equal to or above 10 Mbit/s subscriptions (4213_G10). Refers to all fixed -broadband Internet subscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 10 Mbit/s.Concepts:Fixed broadband subscriptions refer to subscriptions to high-speed access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, DSL, fibre-to-the-home/building, other fixed -broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. This total is measured irrespective of the method of payment. It excludes subscriptions that have access to data communications (including the Internet) via mobile-cellular networks. It should include fixed WiMAX and any other fixed wireless technologies. It includes both residential subscriptions and subscriptions for organizations.The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files."
232,Indicator17-7-1,"Total amount of funding for developing countries to promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies","Definition:Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs) are technologies that have the potential for significantly improved environmental performance relative to other technologies. ESTs protect the environment, are less polluting, use resources in a sustainable manner, recycle more of their wastes and products, and handle all residual wastes in a more environmentally acceptable way than the technologies for which they are substitutes. ESTs are not just individual technologies. They can also be defined as total systems that include know-how, procedures, goods and services, and equipment, as well as organizational and managerial procedures for promoting environmental sustainability. This means that any attempt to provide an assessment of investment into ESTs on either a global or national level must incorporate ways to track funding flows into both hard and soft technologies.The purpose of this indicator is to develop a methodology for tracking the total amount of approved funding to promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies. A two-pronged approach is suggested: Level 1. Use globally available data to create a proxy of funding flowing to countries for environmentally sound technologies, or of trade in environmentally sound technologies Level 2. Collect national data on investment in environmentally sound technologies.Concepts:There are five crucial elements which make up Goal 17 - finance, capacity building, systemic issues, technology and trade- all of which must be aligned for the Goal to be achieved. One of the key lessons over the last couple of decades has been that in  order to achieve potential growth, measurement of financial flows (in terms of amount, type, geography, donor, recipient and investors) is a necessary step in such a transformation. In order to understand systemic issues, trade, capacity building, technology lock-in, innovation and deployment, we must understand how, why and where finance is being deployed. Only then we can begin to realign its flows.In deciding which technologies are most appropriate, there will always be trade-offs between cost and a range of economic, social, health and environmental impacts, to be determined based on national or local contexts and priorities. It would also not be feasible for all countries to strive towards the best available technologies globally if these are not appropriate in a domestic context.  Given the highly contextual nature of ESTs, it is therefore something that is better defined at the national level, taking into account the national context and mainstream technologies nationally. However, there is a real need to support national, sub-national governments and other actors with decision-making and defining the most nationally or locally appropriate technologies."
233,Indicator17-8-1,Proportion of individuals using the Internet,"Definition:The indicator proportion of individuals using the Internet is defined as the proportion of individuals who used the Internet from any location in the last three months.Concepts:The Internet is a worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer - it may also be by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed or mobile network."
234,Indicator17-9-1,"Dollar value of financial and technical assistance (including through North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation) committed to developing countries","Definition:Gross disbursements of total ODA and other official flows from all donors for capacity building and national planning.Concepts:ODA: The DAC defines ODA as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i)	provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii)	each transaction   is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; andis concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). (See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm)Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional.(See http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf,  Para 24)."
235,Indicator17-10-1,Worldwide weighted tariff-average,"Definition:Value in percentage of weighted average tariffs applied to the imports of goods in HS chapter 01-97.Concepts:Weighted average: In order to aggregate tariff value for country groups it is recommended to make use of a weighting methodology based on the value of goods imported.Tariffs: Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either on an ad valorem basis (percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7 per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs."
236,Indicator17-11-1,Developing countries’ and least developed countries’ share of global exports,Definition:Exports by developing countries and LDCs as a share of global exports of goods and servicesConcepts:Harmonized System (HS): Is the international classification used to categorize products that are traded (merchandise trade)Balance of Payments (BoP): Services are classified according to the items presented in the Balance of Payments as defined by the IMF in t the Balance of Payments Manual.
237,Indicator17-12-1,"Weighted average tariffs faced by developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States","Definition:Average import tariffs (in per cent) faced by products exported from developing countries and least developed countries.Concepts:Tariffs: Tariffs are customs duties on merchandise imports, levied either on an ad valorem basis (percentage of value) or on a specific basis (e.g. $7 per 100 kg). Tariffs can be used to create a price advantage for similar locally-produced goods and for raising government revenues. Trade remedy measures and taxes are not considered to be tariffs. Tariff in HS chapters 01-97 is taken into consideration.Tariff line or National Tariff lines (NTL): National Tariff Line codes refer to the classification codes, applied to merchandise goods by individual countries that are longer than the HS six digit level. Countries are free to introduce national distinctions for tariffs and many other purposes.The national tariff line codes are based on the HS system but are longer than six digits. For example, the six digit HS code 010120 refers to Asses, mules and hinnies, live, whereas the US National Tariff line code 010120.10 refers to live purebred breeding asses, 010120.20 refers to live asses other than purebred breeding asses and 010120.30 refers to mules and hinnies imported for immediate slaughter."
238,Indicator17-13-1,Macroeconomic Dashboard,"1. External SectorIndicators for the current and capital & financial accounts are included to monitor each country's trade and balance of payments.  The sustainability of the balance of payments depends on both the current account and the capital and financial account balances, including foreign reserves.Current Account: The current account balance is an important indicator of an economy's health. It is defined as the sum of the resource balance (exports less imports of goods and services), net primary income and secondary income. In addition, the dashboard includes indicators such as merchandise trade as a share of GDP to monitor the trade openness of the country and data on personal remittances, which have become an important integral part of many developing economies, since any changes to these flows may have a major impact on developing countries' current account balances (defined as the savings-investment gap for an economy).Capital and Financial Accounts: Data on capital and financial flows are key for monitoring vulnerability to shocks and constraints on fiscal and monetary policies. Financing trade deficits or other current imbalances through capital and financial flows is a reasonable way to achieve consumption smoothing of emerging economies. FDI equity is a preferred method of financing external current account deficits since these flows are non–debt–creating. Portfolio investment inflows measure the exposure of foreign investors to developing country bond and equity markets.  External indebtedness affects a country's creditworthiness and investor perceptions. Nonreporting countries might have outstanding debts with the World Bank, other international financial institutions, or private creditors. Total debt service is contrasted with countries' ability to obtain foreign exchange through exports of goods, services, primary income, and personal remittances. Debt ratios are used to assess the sustainability of a country's debt service obligations, but no absolute rules determine what values are too high. Exchange Rates:  Sharp devaluations are usually associated with significant declines in equity markets, capital flows, and reserves. The dashboard will present official average exchange rates.Merchandise trade as a proportion of GDP (%)This indicator is used as measurement for the Trade Openness of a country. Merchandise trade as a share of GDP is the sum of merchandise exports and imports divided by the value of GDP.Personal remittances, received, as a proportion of GDP (%)Comprise personal transfers and compensation of employees, as defined in the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual. Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from non-resident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and non-resident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by non-resident entities. Current account balance as a proportion of GDP (%)Current account balance is the sum of net exports of goods and services, net primary income, and net secondary income. Foreign direct investment, net inflows, as a proportion of GDP (%)Comprises the net inflows of foreign direct investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. FDI is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments. This series shows net inflows (new investment inflows less disinvestment) in the reporting economy from foreign investors and is divided by GDP.Portfolio investment, net (BoP, current US$)Portfolio investment covers transactions in equity securities and debt securities. Data are in current US dollars. Total reserves in months of importsTotal reserves comprise holdings of monetary gold, special drawing rights, reserves of IMF members held by the IMF, and holdings of foreign exchange under the control of monetary authorities. The gold component of these reserves is valued at year-end (December 31) London prices. This item shows reserves expressed in terms of the number of months of imports of goods and services they could pay for [Reserves/(Imports/12)].External debt stocks as a proportion of GNI (%)Total external debt is debt owed to non-residents repayable in currency, goods, or services. Total external debt is the sum of public, publicly guaranteed, and private nonguaranteed long-term debt, use of IMF credit, and short-term debt. Short-term debt includes all debt having an original maturity of one year or less and interest in arrears on long-term debt. GNI (formerly GNP) is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad.Debt service (PPG and IMF only, % of exports of goods, services and primary income)Debt service is the sum of principle repayments and interest actually paid in currency, goods, or services. This series differs from the standard debt to exports series. It covers only long-term public and publicly guaranteed debt and repayments (repurchases and charges) to the IMF. Data for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) are from HIPC Initiative's Status of Implementation Report. DEC alternative conversion factor (LCU per US$)The DEC alternative conversion factor is the underlying annual exchange rate used for the World Bank Atlas method. As a rule, it is the official exchange rate reported in the IMF's International Financial Statistics (line rf). Exceptions arise where further refinements are made by World Bank staff. It is expressed in local currency units per US dollar.2. Fiscal SectorFor a sustainable economic growth path, a country needs a sustainable fiscal policy. The dashboard monitors government revenues, fiscal balance, and public debt as a share of GDP to inform policy-decision making. Tax revenue as a proportion of GDP (%)Tax revenue refers to compulsory transfers to the central government for public purposes. Certain compulsory transfers such as fines, penalties, and most social security contributions are excluded. Refunds and corrections of erroneously collected tax revenue are treated as negative revenue. Cash surplus/deficit as a proportion of GDP (%)Cash surplus or deficit is revenue (including grants) minus expense, minus net acquisition of nonfinancial assets. In the 1986 GFS manual nonfinancial assets were included under revenue and expenditure in gross terms. This cash surplus or deficit is closest to the earlier overall budget balance (still missing is lending minus repayments, which are now a financing item under net acquisition of financial assets).Gross PSD, Central Gov.-D2, All maturities, D1+ SDRs + currency and deposits, Nominal Value, as a proportion of GDP (%)The D2 coverage of instruments according to this classification includes (1) debt securities, (2) loans, (3) special drawing rights and (4) currency and deposits as percentage of GDP. 3. Real SectorGDP measures the nation's total output of goods and services. For many decades, it has been a comprehensive measure of market activity used for a wide variety of analytical purposes such as measuring productivity, conducting monetary policy, and projecting tax revenues. In this section, we monitor growth trends of GDP; Gross capital formation; Exports of goods and services; Imports of goods and services; Household consumption; Government consumption; and Consumer Price Index to monitor the price trends.Annual GDP growth (%)GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.Annual growth of the gross capital formation (%)Gross capital formation (formerly gross domestic investment) consists of outlays on additions to the fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of inventories. Fixed assets include dwellings, other buildings and structures (including land improvements),  machinery and equipment, weapons systems, cultivated biological resources, and intellectual property products (R&D, mineral exploration, software, etc.). Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or sales, and ""work in progress."" According to the 2008 SNA, net acquisitions of valuables are also considered capital formation. Annual growth of households and NPISHs final consumption expenditure (%)Household final consumption expenditure (formerly private consumption) is the market value of all goods and services, including durable products (such as cars, washing machines, and home computers), purchased by households. It excludes purchases of dwellings but includes imputed rent for owner-occupied dwellings. It also includes payments and fees to governments to obtain permits and licenses. In WDI, household consumption expenditure includes the expenditures of non-profit institutions serving households, even when reported separately by the country. Annual growth of the general government final consumption expenditure (%)General government final consumption expenditure (formerly general government consumption) includes all government current expenditures for purchases of goods and services (including compensation of employees and consumption of fixed capital). Annual growth of exports of goods and services (%)Exports of goods and services represent the value of all goods and other market services provided to the rest of the world. They include the value of merchandise, freight, insurance, transport, travel, royalties, license fees, and other services, such as communication, construction, financial, information, business, personal, and government services. Annual growth of imports of goods and services (%)Imports of goods and services represent the value of all goods and other market services received from the rest of the world. They include the value of merchandise, freight, insurance, transport, travel, royalties, license fees, and other services, such as communication, construction, financial, information, business, personal, and government services. Annual inflation, consumer prices (%)Consumer price index reflects changes in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specified intervals, such as yearly. The Laspeyres formula is generally used. Data are period averages. 4. Financial SectorFinancial sector indicators are essential for measuring countries' financial market stability and economic stability. Stronger financial institutions play a significant role in a country's economic performance. The strength of those institutions is measured through the following indicators. Bank capital to assets ratio (%)Bank capital to assets is the ratio of bank capital and reserves to total assets. Capital and reserves include funds contributed by owners, retained earnings, general and special reserves, provisions, and valuation adjustments. Capital consists of tier 1 capital (paid-up shares and common stock), which is a common feature in all countries' banking systems, and total regulatory capital, which includes several specified types of subordinated debt instruments that need not be repaid if the funds are required to maintain minimum capital levels (these comprise tier 2 and tier 3 capital). Total assets include all nonfinancial and financial assets. Bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans (%)Bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans is the value of nonperforming loans divided by the total value of the loan portfolio (including nonperforming loans before the deduction of specific loan-loss provisions). The loan amount recorded as nonperforming should be the gross value of the loan as recorded on the balance sheet, not just the amount that is overdue. Annual broad money growth (%)Broad money is the sum of currency outside banks; demand deposits other than those of the central government; the time, savings, and foreign currency deposits of resident sectors other than the central government; bank and traveler's checks; and other securities such as certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Broad money to total reserves ratioBroad money (IFS line 35L.. ZK) is the sum of currency outside banks; demand deposits other than those of the central government; the time, savings, and foreign currency deposits of resident sectors other than the central government; bank and traveler's checks; and other securities such as certificates of deposit and commercial paper. 5. UnemploymentTrends in unemployment rate data are a vital indicator for analyzing the long-term economic development of a country (SDG 8.5.2). Stronger and sustainable economic growth often results in lower unemployment rates. Total unemployment out of total labor force (national estimate) (%)Unemployment refers to the share of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment.

239,Indicator17-14-1,Number of countries with mechanisms in place to enhance policy coherence of sustainable development,"Definition: For the purpose of this methodology ‘policy coherence of sustainable development’ has been interpreted as the coherence between policies in general that cover the dimensions of sustainable development. This indicator is a composite indicator which covers mechanisms related to: Institutionalization of Political Commitment 	Long-term considerations in decision-makingInter-ministerial and cross-sectoral coordination	Participatory processesPolicy linkagesAlignment across government levelsMonitoring and reporting for policy coherenceFinancing for policy coherenceConcepts:Scope of “Sustainable Development”: For the purpose of this methodology ‘policy coherence of sustainable development’ has been interpreted as the coherence between policies in general that cover the dimensions of sustainable development, rather than adopting a narrower definition of mechanisms put in place to support the coherent implementation of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), so as to promote coherent policy for sustainable development well beyond the current agenda’s timeframe. The policy coherence mechanisms set out in this methodology may therefore include mechanisms already in place before the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, and any mechanisms established during the next decade leading up to 2030 should aim to continue well beyond that timeframe. However, given the role of Agenda 2030 and the individual goals in defining the specific parameters of sustainable development, it is likely that governments will focus, in implementing this methodology, on bringing coherence in their policy approaches to implement the goals. The concept of Policy Coherence: The textual formulation of the indicator covers “policy coherence”. In order to make the indicator universally applicable and adaptable to various national contexts, the mechanisms measured by the methodology cover a wide range of mechanisms that, although aiming to achieve the same objective, use slightly different language. In order to properly assess and report on this indicator, similar concepts such as “whole of government approach or “integrated approach” will be interpreted in the same spirit as the concept of “policy coherence”. However, it is important that the used concept considers policies that cover the various dimensions of sustainable development. Hence, a mechanism focusing solely on the concept of policy coherence for development (which is often limited to coherence between Official Development Assistance (ODA) and other policies, in the spirit of the Millennium Development Goals) will not be considered by this framework.  "
240,Indicator17-15-1,Extent of use of country-owned results frameworks and planning tools by providers of development cooperation,"Definition:This indicator measures the extent to which, and the ways in which, all concerned development partners use country-owned results frameworks (CRFs) to plan development cooperation efforts and assess their performance.  The indicator assesses the degree to which providers of development cooperation (i.e. development partners) design their interventions by relying on objectives and results indicators that are drawn from country government-owned results frameworks reflecting the country’s development priorities and goals.  Concepts:Country-owned results frameworks (CRFs) define a country’s approach to results and its associated monitoring and evaluation systems focusing on performance and achievement of development results. Using a minimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, outcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in the government’s planning documents. The definition of country-owned results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use equivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their priorities through consistent, integrated CRFs.In practice, country-owned results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. long-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector level (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe.Some examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-multi-donor plans; government’s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, as well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices & sector-wide approaches). In contrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country strategies prepared by development partners, are not considered CRFs."
241,Indicator17-16-1,Number of countries reporting progress in multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks that support the achievement of the sustainable development goals,"Definition:The indicator tracks the number of countries reporting progress in multi-stakeholder monitoring frameworks that track the implementation of development effectiveness commitments supporting the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs).  Concepts:“Multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks” that track effective development cooperation are monitoring frameworks: •	whose indicators have been agreed on a voluntary basis; whose indicators measure the strength of the relationship between development actors; •	where data collection and review are led by the countries themselves; and where participation in data collection and review involves relevant stakeholders representing, at minimum, the public sector, the private sector and civil society organizations.The indicator takes into account the need to capture the respective roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in multi-stakeholder partnerships for development. It does so by looking at development effectiveness frameworks that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant development partners. The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (Global Partnership) monitoring framework is an example of existing development effectiveness monitoring frameworks. There are other complementary efforts, such as the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) mutual accountability survey. Emerging and future monitoring frameworks that fit the above definition, such as recent efforts to track South-South Cooperation by the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), could also be considered."

243,Indicator17-18-1,Statistical capacity indicator for Sustainable Development Goal monitoring,"Definitions:The Open Data Inventory (ODIN) is an evaluation of the coverage and openness of data provided on the websites maintained by national statistical offices (NSOs) and any official government website that is accessible from the NSO site, as well as a country’s official SDG portal. Capacity to produce a set of official statistics from national databases to support the SDGs: The ODIN Coverage Index refers to the availability of important statistical indicators in 22 categories of social, economic, and environmental statistics. Each data category is assessed on five elements of coverage (see below) that measure how complete the country’s data offerings are. Information on all elements are collected for each dataset assessed in ODIN, except for elements 4 and 5 (see below) that are not included for some data categories or for small countries. The five coverage elements (further described in 4.c) are:Availability of indicators and disaggregationsAvailability of data in the last five yearsAvailability of data in the last ten yearsAvailability of data at the first administrative geographic levelAvailability of data at the second administrative geographic levelScores are assigned for each element of each data category, not indicator. In addition, each data category cannot score higher on coverage elements 2-5 than coverage element 1. Aggregate scores are computed across categories and elements."
244,Indicator17-18-2,Number of countries that have national statistical legislation that complies with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics,"Definition:The indicator refers to the number of countries that have national statistical legislation that complies with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. This refers to the number of countries that have a statistical legislation which respects the principles of UNFOP.Concepts:National statistical legislation: The statistics law defines rules, regulation, measures with regard to theorganization, management, monitoring and inspection of the statistical activities in a systematic way, strength, effectiveness and efficiency to assure the full coverage, accuracy and consistency with facts in order to provide reference for policy direction, socio economic planning, and contribute to thecountry’s development to achieve wealth, culture, well-being and equity.UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics The Fundamental Principles for Official Statistics adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission, in its Special Session of 11-15 April 1994 are:Principle 1. Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a society, serving the government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens’ entitlement to public information.Principle 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data.Principle 3. To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, the statistical agencies are to present information according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics.Principle 4. The statistical agencies are entitled to comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics. Principle 5. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn from all types of sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents. Principle 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes. Principle 7. The laws, regulations and measures under which the statistical systems operate are to be made public. Principle 8. Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system. Principle 9. The use by statistical agencies in each country of international concepts, classifications and methods promotes the consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels. Principle 10. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics contributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries."
